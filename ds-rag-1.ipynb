Thus, there are around 4200 judges\\n(combined strength of judges of Superior Courts, Subordinate Courts and Special\\nCourts/Administrative Tribunals) for a population of 180 million in Pakistan.

As first instance trial\\ncourts, most of the civil and criminal litigation is conducted at this level. According to one estimate,\\naround 90% of litigation in Pakistan is conducted at the level of Subordinate Courts and the rest atthe level of High Courts and Supreme Court. The Subordinate Courts also operate under many\\nconstraints. There exists shortage of courtrooms, judicial officers, ministerial staff and office\\nequipment. The strength of Subordinate Judiciary has not kept pace with the rise in litigation due to\\nwhich huge backlog of pending cases is accumulated, and there are enormous delays in deciding\\ncases. As against the recommendations of several law reform commissions and committees that the\\nnumber of cases pending with a civil judge should not be more than 500 and the number of units\\npending with a District & Sessions Judge should not be more than 450 at a time, in actual practice,\\nthe number of cases and units is far in excess of this prescribed limit.\\n8.2\\nNational Judicial Policy'}\n",

For appointment of\\nChief Justice, however, the most senior judge of the Federal Shariat Court is excluded from the\\ncomposition of the Commission. Once the Judicial Commission approves a new name for\\nappointment as a judge of the Federal Shariat Court, it goes to an 8-member Parliamentary\\nCommittee that has equal representation of the Government and the Opposition as well as of two\\nhouses i.e. National Assembly and Senate. This Committee has two weeks to review the\\nrecommendation. If the recommendation is approved, it goes to the Prime Minister who forwards\\nthe same to the President for appointment. The Parliamentary Committee, for reasons to berecorded, may not confirm the recommendation by three-fourth majority, in which instance, the\\ndecision is forwarded to the Commission through the Prime Minister, and the Commission is\\nrequired to send another nomination.\\nOf the 8 judges, 3 are required to be Ulema (Islamic scholars), who are well versed in Islamic law.

The Court also exercises appellate\\nand revisional jurisdiction over the criminal courts, deciding Hudood cases.51\\nThe decisions of the Court are binding on the High Courts as well as Subordinate Judiciary.52 The\\nCourt appoints its own staff53 and frames its own rules of procedure.54 On 31st December 2013, a total\\nof 997 cases were pending before the Court.55Ever since its establishment in 1980, the Federal Shariat Court has been the subject of controversy in\\nthe country. Created as an Islamisation measure by the Military regime56 and subsequently\\nprotected under the controversial 8th Amendment,57 its opponents question the very rationale and\\nutility of this institution. It is argued that this Court merely duplicates the functions of the existing\\nsuperior courts. The composition of the Court, particularly the loose qualifications of judges and the\\ninsecurity of their tenure, is taken exception to; and it is alleged, that this Court does not fully meet\\nthe criterion prescribed for the independence of the judiciary, hence, susceptible to pressure and\\ninfluence from the Executive. In the past, this Court was used as a dumping ground for therecalcitrant judges. And whereas some of its judgments, particularly the ones which relying on the\\nIslamic concept of equity, justice and fair play, expanded and enlarged the scope and contents of\\nindividual's rights were commended, others that validated the controversial Hudood laws, in\\nparticular, the sentence of Rajam (stoning to death) are severely criticised and deplored. With the\\nadoption of Protection of Women (Criminal Laws Amendment) Act 2006, the jurisdiction of the\\nCourt is considerably curtailed, inasmuch as, appeals/applications for revision arising out of trial of\\noffences are taken out from the Offence of Zina (Enforcement of Hudood) Ordinance 1979, hence are\\nno longer filed before this Court. They are filed before the High Court. In a recent verdict (ShariatPetition 1/1 of 2010), the Court sought to extend its jurisdiction to all matters mentioned as Hudood\\nin the Islamic injunctions and further declared certain amendments to the Protection of Women\\n(Criminal Law Amendment) Act 2006 as repugnant to the injunctions of Islam. However an appeal\\nagainst this decision has been filed before the Supreme Court and as such the implementation of\\nthis judgment is stayed. Appeals against the judgments of the Federal Shariat are heard by the 5member Shariat Appellate Bench of the said Court.\"}\n",

The Parliamentary Committee, for reasons to be recorded, may not\\nconfirm the recommendation by three-fourth majority, in which instance, the decision is forwarded\\nto the Commission through the Prime Minister; and in that eventuality, the Commission is required\\nto send another nomination.23Notwithstanding the procedure provided in Article 175A, the President has to appoint the most\\nsenior judge of the Supreme Court as the Chief Justice of Pakistan. As per opinion of the Supreme\\nCourt, on a Reference received from the President, the Government is not authorized to decide inter\\nse seniority of the judges.24 The issue was resolved by another verdict of the Supreme Court, wherein\\nit was held that the inter se sonority of judges of High Court shall reckon from the date of their\\nappointment as Additional Judge of High Court; however if appointed on the same day, then it shall\\nreckon from their seniority in age.25\\n23Art 175A\\nReference No.1 of 2012\\n25\\nMuhammad Aslam Awan v Federation, 2014 SCMR 1289\\n24\\n\\n8\\n\\n\\x0cThe Judicial System of PakistanFor appointment of Chief Justice and judges of Federal Shariat Court, the Chief Justice and most\\nsenior judge of the said court are added to the composition of the Judicial Commission, provided\\nthat for appointment of the Chief Justice, the most senior judge is excluded from such composition.\\nSimilarly, for appointment of Chief Justices and judges of High Courts, the Chief Justice and senior\\nmost judge of the respective High Court, provincial minister for law and an advocate of High Court\\n(15 years standing), as nominee of the provincial bar council, are added to the composition of the\\nCommission. However, for appointment of Chief Justice, the senior most judge is excluded from\\nsuch composition. Just like appointments in the Supreme Court, the Chief Justices and judges of theFederal Shariat Court and High Courts are appointed by the President through their nomination by\\nthe Judicial Commission and confirmation by the Parliamentary Committee.\\n4.2\\nAccountability\\nThe system of accountability is an essential prerequisite of the independence of judiciary. The\\nConstitution of Pakistan prescribes such procedure in the form of Supreme Judicial Council. The\\nSupreme Judicial Council is a unique institution, which comprises the senior most judges in judicial\\nhierarchy and entrusted with the onerous responsibility of deciding complaints that are referred to\\nit. The Supreme Judicial Council is comprised of the Chief Justice of Pakistan, as Chairman, with two\\nmost senior Judges of the Supreme Court and two most senior Chief Justices of High Courts, asmembers. The Registrar, Supreme Court of Pakistan acts as its Secretary. On a reference received\\nfrom President or through suo moto action, the Supreme Judicial Council investigates the matter\\nand presents its finding to the President. If the Council decides that the Judge is incapable of\\nperforming the duties of office or is guilty of misconduct, and therefore should be removed from\\noffice, the President may order the removal of such judge. A judge may not be removed from service\\nexcept on the specified grounds and subject to the prescribed procedure.26\\n4.3\\nSupreme Court\\nThe Supreme Court is the apex Court of the land, exercising original, appellate and advisory\\njurisdiction.27 It is the Court of ultimate appeal and final arbiter of law and the Constitution. Itsdecisions are binding on all other courts.28 The Court consists of a Chief Justice and other judges,29\\nappointed by the President as per procedure laid down in the Constitution.30 An Act of Parliament\\nhas fixed the number of Judges at 17 i.e. Chief Justice and 16 judges.31 There is also a provision for\\nappointment of acting judges as well as ad hoc judges in the court.32 A person with 5 years\\nexperience as a Judge of a High Court or 15 years standing as an advocate of a High Court, is eligible\\nto be appointed as judge of the Supreme Court.33\\n26'}\n",

This Court, in hierarchy, was next to the King's Court and appeal\\nagainst its decisions lay to the King's Court. The judges were appointed on the basis of their\\nqualifications and scholarship but the choice was mostly restricted to upper caste i.e. Brahmins.1\\n\\n\\x0cThe Judicial System of PakistanAt the village level, tribunals dispensed justice, which consisted of the assembly of the village, or the\\ncaste or the family.1 The village Headman acted as Judge/Magistrate for the community. Decisions\\nby such tribunals were usually through conciliation. The decisions of village/town courts/tribunals\\nwere appealable in the higher courts and final appeal lay before the King's Court. Besides\\nadjudication, the system of arbitration was also in vogue.\\nAs regards the procedure followed in the courts/tribunals, no formal rules existed, as the law\\napplicable was not statutory but customary or moral. The determination of truth and punishment of\\nthe wrong-doer was regarded as a religious duty. Civil proceedings commenced with the filing of aclaim which was replied to by the opposite party. Both parties were allowed to produce witnesses so\\nas to prove their respective claims. On the conclusion of the trial, decision was pronounced which\\nwas duly enforced. It appears thus, that the system of administration of justice, as it operated in\\nancient India, was not substantially different from what it is in the modern times. In a sense, the\\ncurrent system seems to be a continuation of the former practices and procedures.\\n2.2\\nMuslim Period\\nThe Muslim period in the Indian sub-continent roughly begins in the 11th century A.D. This period\\nmay be divided into two parts i.e. the period of early Muslim rulers who ruled Delhi and some other\\nparts of India and the Mughal period, which replaced such Muslim and other rulers in 1526 A.D. TheMughal Dynasty lasted until the middle of 19th century.\\nDuring the period of Muslim rulers, the Islamic law remained the law of the land in settling civil and\\ncriminal disputes. However, common customs and traditions were also invoked in settling secular\\nmatters. These rulers were not particularly keen on applying the Islamic law to each and every sphere\\nof life, and let the indigenous customs and institutions continue side by side with Islamic law and\\ninstitutions. During this period, different courts were established and functioned at the central,\\nprovincial, district and tehsil (Pargana) level. These courts had defined jurisdiction in civil, criminal\\nand revenue matters and operated under the authority of the King. On the top of judicial hierarchywas the King's Court, presided over by the King himself, exercising original as well as appellate\\njurisdiction. The King was the head of judicial administration and he made all appointments to\\njudicial posts. Persons of recognised scholarship, known competence and high integrity were\\nappointed to such posts. The judges held office during the pleasure of the King.\\nThe Mughals improved upon the previous experience and created an organised system of\\nadministration of justice, all over the country. Courts were created at each and every unit of the\\nadministrative division. At the village level, the Hindu system of Panchayats (Council of Elders) was\\nretained, which decided petty disputes of civil and criminal nature, using conciliation and mediationas means of settling disputes. At the town level, there existed courts, presided over by1\\n\\n14th Report of Law Commission of India, 1958, Vol. I, p 26\\n\\n2\\n\\n\\x0cThe Judicial System of PakistanQazi-e-Parganah. Similarly, at the district (Sarkar) and provincial (Subah) level, courts of Qazis were\\nestablished. The highest court at the provincial level was that of Adalat Nazim-e-Subah. Similarly, for\\nrevenue cases, officers known as Ameen were appointed at the town level. At the district level,\\nrevenue cases were dealt with by Amalguzar and at the provincial level by Diwan.\\nThe supreme revenue court was called, the Imperial Diwan. Side by side, with civil and revenue\\ncourts, criminal courts, presided over by Faujdar, Kotwal, Shiqdar and Subedar functioned.2 The\\nhighest court of the land was the Emperor's Court, exercising original and appellate jurisdiction.\\nAlthough these courts generally exercised exclusive jurisdiction in different categories of cases,however, sometimes their jurisdiction was inter-mixed, in as much as, officers dealing with criminal\\ncases were also required to act as revenue courts. Furthermore, whereas territorially, these courts\\nformed a concentric organization, their jurisdiction was not always exclusive on the basis of\\nterritorial limits. Thus, a plaintiff may choose to file his suit in a town or a district or a province. The\\npecuniary jurisdiction of the courts was also not defined; hence, a case of higher value may be filed in\\na court of small town. Similarly, appellate jurisdiction existed but was not well defined. Thus, a\\nplaintiff or a complainant, not satisfied with a decision, may file a second suit/complaint in another\"}\n",

This Court\\nconsisted of a Chief Justice and such other number of judges, not exceeding 15. The Act prescribed\\nprofessional qualifications for such judges together with the mode of their appointment. Thus, it\\nwas provided that 1/3rd of the judges should be appointed from amongst the barristers with 5 years\\nstanding and 1/3rd from amongst the civil servants, having 3 years experience as a District Judge.\\nThe remaining 1/3rd seats were filled from amongst pleaders and members of SubordinateJudiciary, having 5 years experience. The judges were appointed by the Crown and held office\\nduring his pleasure. The High Courts exercised original as well as appellate jurisdiction in civil and\\ncriminal matters and were also required to supervise the functioning of the Subordinate Courts in\\ntheir respective domain. Besides the Presidency Towns, High Courts were also established in\\nAllahabad in 1866, Patna in 1919, Lahore in 1919 and Rangoon in 1936. The Sindh Chief Court was\\nestablished under the Sind Courts Act 1926. Similarly, under the NWFP Courts Regulation 1931 and4\\n\\n\\x0cThe Judicial System of Pakistanthe British Balochistan Courts Regulation 1939, the Court of Judicial Commissioner was created in\\neach such area.\\nThe Code of Civil Procedure 1908 created principal civil courts, namely, the Court of District Judge,\\nthe Court of Additional District Judge, the Court of Civil Judge and the Court of Munsif. Their\\nterritorial and pecuniary jurisdictions were also defined.\\nThe Government of India Act 1935 retained the High Courts and also provided for the creation of a\\nFederal Court.6 The Federal Court was established in 1937. Its judges were appointed by the Crown\\nand held office till completing the age of 65 years. The qualifications prescribed were, 5 years\\nexperience as a judge of a High Court or 10 years experience as a barrister or 10 years experience as apleader in a High Court. The Act further provided that the judges of the Federal Court and High\\nCourts should hold office during good health and behaviour, meaning, they may not be removed\\nexcept on the grounds of infirmity of mind or body or misbehaviour, only when on a reference made\\nby the Crown, the Judicial Committee of Privy Council so recommends. The Federal Court exercised\\noriginal, appellate and advisory jurisdiction.73.\\n\\nPost-Independence EvolutionOn independence, the Government of India Act 1935 was retained as a provisional Constitution. As a\\nconsequence, the legal and judicial system of the British period continued, of course, with due\\nadaptations and modifications, where necessary, to suit the requirements of the new Republic. This\\nway, there occurred no vacuum or breakdown, and the operation of the legal system continued\\nuninterrupted. The judicial structure also remained the same. The Lahore High Court continued to\\nfunction and so did the Sindh Chief Court and the courts of Judicial Commissioner in NWFP and\\nBalochistan. A new High Court was set up at Dacca.8 Similarly, a new Federal Court for Pakistan was\\nalso established.9 The powers, authority and jurisdiction of the Federal Court and High Courts, asprescribed in the Government of India Act 1935, remained intact.\\nThe Government of India Act 1935 was amended in 1954 with a view to empower the High Courts to\\nissue the prerogative writs.10 The subsequent Constitutions i.e. 1956, 1962 and 1973 did not\\ndrastically alter the judicial structure or the powers and jurisdiction of the superior courts. The\\nchanges effected were, renaming the Federal Court as the Supreme Court by the 1956 Constitution\\nand the upgradation of the Chief Court of NWFP and Judicial Commissioner Court of Balochistan\\ninto full-fledged High Courts, by the 1973 Constitution. Later on, a new court called, Federal Shariat6\\n\\nSection 200\\nSection 204, 205, 207, 213\\n8\\nBy the High Court (Bengal) Order 1947\\n9\\nBy the Federal Government of Pakistan Order 1948\\n10\\nSection 223-A\\n7\\n\\n5\\n\\n\\x0cThe Judicial System of PakistanCourt was created in 198011 with jurisdiction to determine, suo moto or on petition by a citizen or the\\nFederal or a provincial Government, as to whether or not a certain provision of law is repugnant to\\nthe injunctions of Islam.12\\nPakistan being a Federal Republic, the provinces enjoy wide powers, and subjects to administer\\nincluding the administration of justice. The High Court is the principal court of the province, which\\nexercises original jurisdiction (issuing writ for enforcement of Fundamental Rights) and appellate\\njurisdiction (against orders/judgments of Subordinate Courts and special courts). The Subordinate\\nCourts function under the administrative control of the High Court. All such courts are funded by the\\nProvincial Government.\\n\\n4.\\n\\nSuperior JudiciaryThe Constitution of Pakistan deals with the superior judiciary in a fairly comprehensive manner and\\ncontains elaborate provisions on the composition, jurisdiction, powers and functions of these\\ncourts. The Constitution provides for the “separation of judiciary from the executive” and the\\n“independence of judiciary”13 It entrusts the superior courts with an obligation to “preserve, protect\\nand defend” the Constitution.14 The qualifications of judges, their mode of appointment,15 service\\nconditions, salary, pension,16 etc. are also laid down in the Constitution. The remuneration of judges\\nand other administrative expenditures of the superior courts are charged on the Federal/Provincial\\nConsolidated Fund,17 which means it may be discussed but cannot be voted upon in the legislature.The Constitution also provides for the grounds as well as forum and procedure for the removal of\\njudges of the superior courts.18 The Supreme Judicial Council, consisting of the senior judges of the\\nSupreme Court and High Courts, on its own or on a reference made by the President, may\\nrecommend the removal of a Judge on the ground of misconduct or physical or mental incapacity.\\nThus, the Constitution ensures the freedom, independence and impartiality of the superior\\njudiciary.\\nThe Supreme Court and High Courts have recently been given a degree of financial autonomy.

      "\n",
      "The roots of the current judicial system of Pakistan stretch back to the medieval period and even\n",
      "before. The judicial system that we practice today has evolved over a long period of time, spanning\n",
      "roughly over a whole millennium. The system has passed through several epochs, covering the\n",
      "Hindu era, Muslim period including the Mughal Empire, British colonial period and postindependence chapter. Notwithstanding the successive changes i.e. one rule/dynasty substituted\n",
      "by the other, which naturally resulted in the socio-economic and political transformation of the\n",
      "Indian society, the judicial system generally maintained a steady growth and gradual advance\n",
      "towards consolidation and improvement/refinement, without indeed, having to undergo any major\n",
      "disruption or breakdown.\n",
      "All in all, the system experienced and passed through 3 distinct stages of historical development,\n",
      "namely, Hindu Kingdom, Muslim Rule and British Colonial Administration. The 4th and current era,\n",
      "commenced with the partition of India and the establishment of Pakistan, as a sovereign and\n",
      "independent State. The system, thus, has evolved through a process of reform and development.\n",
      "This conclusion enjoys near unanimity among historians and commentators of Indian legal history.\n",
      "During this process of evolution and growth, the judicial system did receive influences and\n",
      "inspirations from foreign doctrines/notions and indigenous norms/practices, both in terms of\n",
      "organizing courts' structure, hierarchy, jurisdiction and adopting trial procedures/practices.\n",
      "Therefore, the present judicial system is not an entirely foreign transplant, as is commonly alleged,\n",
      "but has acquired an indigenous flavour and national colour. And whereas the system may not fully\n",
      "suit the genius of our people or meet the local conditions, its continued application and practice has\n",
      "made it intelligible to the common man. The very fact that increasing number of people are\n",
      "resorting to the courts for the resolution of their conflicts/disputes, indicates that the system enjoys\n",
      "a degree of legitimacy and acceptance.\n",

      "Historical Retrospect\n",

      "2.1\n",
      "Hindu Period\n",
      "The Hindu period lasts for 3 millennia i.e. from 1500 BC until 1500 AD. Information on the judicial\n",
      "system during Hindu period has been somewhat sketchy, gathered mostly from scattered sources,\n",
      "such as ancient books like Dharamshastra, Smiritis and Arthashastra, and commentaries of the same\n",
      "by historians and jurists. These sources construct a well-defined system of administration of justice\n",
      "during the Hindu period. The King was regarded as the fountain of justice who also discharged\n",
      "judicial functions. In this task, judges as well as his ministers and counselors assisted him. He was the\n",
      "final judicial authority and court of ultimate appeal. At the Capital, besides the King's Court, the\n",
      "Court of Chief Justice existed. This Court, in hierarchy, was next to the King's Court and appeal\n",
      "against its decisions lay to the King's Court. The judges were appointed on the basis of their\n",
      "qualifications and scholarship but the choice was mostly restricted to upper caste i.e. Brahmins.\n",
      "\n",
      "1\n",
      "\n",
      "\fThe Judicial System of Pakistan\n",
      "\n",
      "At the village level, tribunals dispensed justice, which consisted of the assembly of the village, or the\n",
      "caste or the family.1 The village Headman acted as Judge/Magistrate for the community. Decisions\n",
      "by such tribunals were usually through conciliation. The decisions of village/town courts/tribunals\n",
      "were appealable in the higher courts and final appeal lay before the King's Court. Besides\n",
      "adjudication, the system of arbitration was also in vogue.\n",
      "As regards the procedure followed in the courts/tribunals, no formal rules existed, as the law\n",
      "applicable was not statutory but customary or moral. The determination of truth and punishment of\n",
      "the wrong-doer was regarded as a religious duty. Civil proceedings commenced with the filing of a\n",
      "claim which was replied to by the opposite party. Both parties were allowed to produce witnesses so\n",
      "as to prove their respective claims. On the conclusion of the trial, decision was pronounced which\n",
      "was duly enforced. It appears thus, that the system of administration of justice, as it operated in\n",
      "ancient India, was not substantially different from what it is in the modern times. In a sense, the\n",
      "current system seems to be a continuation of the former practices and procedures.\n",
      "2.2\n",
      "Muslim Period\n",
      "The Muslim period in the Indian sub-continent roughly begins in the 11th century A.D. This period\n",
      "may be divided into two parts i.e. the period of early Muslim rulers who ruled Delhi and some other\n",
      "parts of India and the Mughal period, which replaced such Muslim and other rulers in 1526 A.D. The\n",
      "Mughal Dynasty lasted until the middle of 19th century.\n",
      "During the period of Muslim rulers, the Islamic law remained the law of the land in settling civil and\n",
      "criminal disputes. However, common customs and traditions were also invoked in settling secular\n",
      "matters. These rulers were not particularly keen on applying the Islamic law to each and every sphere\n",
      "of life, and let the indigenous customs and institutions continue side by side with Islamic law and\n",
      "institutions. During this period, different courts were established and functioned at the central,\n",
      "provincial, district and tehsil (Pargana) level. These courts had defined jurisdiction in civil, criminal\n",
      "and revenue matters and operated under the authority of the King. On the top of judicial hierarchy\n",
      "was the King's Court, presided over by the King himself, exercising original as well as appellate\n",
      "jurisdiction. The King was the head of judicial administration and he made all appointments to\n",
      "judicial posts. Persons of recognised scholarship, known competence and high integrity were\n",
      "appointed to such posts. The judges held office during the pleasure of the King.\n",
      "The Mughals improved upon the previous experience and created an organised system of\n",
      "administration of justice, all over the country. Courts were created at each and every unit of the\n",
      "administrative division. At the village level, the Hindu system of Panchayats (Council of Elders) was\n",
      "retained, which decided petty disputes of civil and criminal nature, using conciliation and mediation\n",
      "as means of settling disputes. At the town level, there existed courts, presided over by\n",

      "Qazi-e-Parganah. Similarly, at the district (Sarkar) and provincial (Subah) level, courts of Qazis were\n",
      "established. The highest court at the provincial level was that of Adalat Nazim-e-Subah. Similarly, for\n",
      "revenue cases, officers known as Ameen were appointed at the town level. At the district level,\n",
      "revenue cases were dealt with by Amalguzar and at the provincial level by Diwan.\n",
      "The supreme revenue court was called, the Imperial Diwan. Side by side, with civil and revenue\n",
      "courts, criminal courts, presided over by Faujdar, Kotwal, Shiqdar and Subedar functioned.2 The\n",
      "highest court of the land was the Emperor's Court, exercising original and appellate jurisdiction.\n",
      "Although these courts generally exercised exclusive jurisdiction in different categories of cases,\n",
      "however, sometimes their jurisdiction was inter-mixed, in as much as, officers dealing with criminal\n",
      "cases were also required to act as revenue courts. Furthermore, whereas territorially, these courts\n",
      "formed a concentric organization, their jurisdiction was not always exclusive on the basis of\n",
      "territorial limits. Thus, a plaintiff may choose to file his suit in a town or a district or a province. The\n",
      "pecuniary jurisdiction of the courts was also not defined; hence, a case of higher value may be filed in\n",
      "a court of small town. Similarly, appellate jurisdiction existed but was not well defined. Thus, a\n",
      "plaintiff or a complainant, not satisfied with a decision, may file a second suit/complaint in another\n",
      "court. Such later court would decide the matter afresh, without indeed taking into consideration\n",
      "the earlier finding of the court.\n",
      "The emperor made the judicial appointments and persons of high scholarship and good reputation\n",
      "were appointed to the posts. Instructions were given to the judges to be neutral and impartial; and\n",
      "complaints against them were taken seriously. Corrupt officials were removed. Consequently, the\n",
      "scales of justice were very high.3\n",
      "The procedure followed in civil cases was not much different from the procedure, which is applicable\n",
      "today. On a suit being filed, the court summoned the opposite party to admit or deny the claim.\n",
      "Issues were framed in the presence of both the parties who were then required to produce evidence\n",
      "in support of their respective claims. Simple cases were decided, based on such evidence, however,\n",
      "in complicated cases, the judge may launch his own investigation into the matter.4 Maximum effort\n",
      "was made to find the truth. On the conclusion of the proceedings, judgment was pronounced and\n",
      "duly executed. Litigants were allowed to present their cases either personally or through agents.\n",
      "Such agents were not exactly lawyers (in the modern sense of the term) but were fully conversant\n",
      "with the judicial procedure. An officer of the court called Mufti, attached to the court, made the\n",

      "employees. The Company therefore established its own courts. The President and Council of the\n",
      "Company decided all cases of civil or criminal nature. The subsequent charters further expanded\n",
      "such powers. Thus, the Charter of 1661 authorized the Governor and Council to decide not only the\n",
      "cases of the Company employees but also of persons residing in the settlements. In deciding such\n",
      "cases, the Governor and the Council applied the English laws. As the character of the Company\n",
      "changed from one of a trading concern into a territorial power, newer and additional courts were\n",
      "established for deciding cases and settling disputes of its employees and subjects. The\n",
      "administration of justice was initially confined to the Presidency Town of Bombay, Calcutta and\n",

      "there, the administration of justice, which developed in these Towns, was not uniform. There were\n",
      "established two sets of courts, one for the Presidency Towns and the other for the Mufussil. The\n",
      "principal courts for the town were known as the Supreme Courts and Recorders Courts. These courts\n",
      "consisted of English judges and applied English laws. The English people, residing in such towns\n",

      "Introduction\n",
      "\n",
      "The roots of the current judicial system of Pakistan stretch back to the medieval period and even\n",
      "before. The judicial system that we practice today has evolved over a long period of time, spanning\n",
      "roughly over a whole millennium. The system has passed through several epochs, covering the\n",
      "Hindu era, Muslim period including the Mughal Empire, British colonial period and postindependence chapter. Notwithstanding the successive changes i.e. one rule/dynasty substituted\n",
      "by the other, which naturally resulted in the socio-economic and political transformation of the\n",
      "Indian society, the judicial system generally maintained a steady growth and gradual advance\n",
      "towards consolidation and improvement/refinement, without indeed, having to undergo any major\n",
      "disruption or breakdown.\n",
      "All in all, the system experienced and passed through 3 distinct stages of historical development,\n",
      "namely, Hindu Kingdom, Muslim Rule and British Colonial Administration. The 4th and current era,\n",
      "commenced with the partition of India and the establishment of Pakistan, as a sovereign and\n",
      "independent State. The system, thus, has evolved through a process of reform and development.\n",
      "This conclusion enjoys near unanimity among historians and commentators of Indian legal history.\n",
      "During this process of evolution and growth, the judicial system did receive influences and\n",
      "inspirations from foreign doctrines/notions and indigenous norms/practices, both in terms of\n",
      "organizing courts' structure, hierarchy, jurisdiction and adopting trial procedures/practices.\n",
      "Therefore, the present judicial system is not an entirely foreign transplant, as is commonly alleged,\n",
      "but has acquired an indigenous flavour and national colour. And whereas the system may not fully\n",
      "suit the genius of our people or meet the local conditions, its continued application and practice has\n",
      "made it intelligible to the common man. The very fact that increasing number of people are\n",
      "resorting to the courts for the resolution of their conflicts/disputes, indicates that the system enjoys\n",
      "a degree of legitimacy and acceptance.\n",

      "Historical Retrospect\n",

      "2.1\n",
      "Hindu Period\n",
      "The Hindu period lasts for 3 millennia i.e. from 1500 BC until 1500 AD. Information on the judicial\n",
      "system during Hindu period has been somewhat sketchy, gathered mostly from scattered sources,\n",
      "such as ancient books like Dharamshastra, Smiritis and Arthashastra, and commentaries of the same\n",
      "by historians and jurists. These sources construct a well-defined system of administration of justice\n",
      "during the Hindu period. The King was regarded as the fountain of justice who also discharged\n",
      "judicial functions. In this task, judges as well as his ministers and counselors assisted him. He was the\n",
      "final judicial authority and court of ultimate appeal. At the Capital, besides the King's Court, the\n",
      "Court of Chief Justice existed. This Court, in hierarchy, was next to the King's Court and appeal\n",
      "against its decisions lay to the King's Court. The judges were appointed on the basis of their\n",
      "qualifications and scholarship but the choice was mostly restricted to upper caste i.e. Brahmins.\n",
      "\n",
      "1\n",
      "\n",
      "\fThe Judicial System of Pakistan\n",
      "\n",
      "At the village level, tribunals dispensed justice, which consisted of the assembly of the village, or the\n",
      "caste or the family.1 The village Headman acted as Judge/Magistrate for the community. Decisions\n",
      "by such tribunals were usually through conciliation. The decisions of village/town courts/tribunals\n",
      "were appealable in the higher courts and final appeal lay before the King's Court. Besides\n",
      "adjudication, the system of arbitration was also in vogue.\n",
      "As regards the procedure followed in the courts/tribunals, no formal rules existed, as the law\n",
      "applicable was not statutory but customary or moral. The determination of truth and punishment of\n",
      "the wrong-doer was regarded as a religious duty. Civil proceedings commenced with the filing of a\n",
      "claim which was replied to by the opposite party. Both parties were allowed to produce witnesses so\n",
      "as to prove their respective claims. On the conclusion of the trial, decision was pronounced which\n",
      "was duly enforced. It appears thus, that the system of administration of justice, as it operated in\n",
      "ancient India, was not substantially different from what it is in the modern times. In a sense, the\n",
      "current system seems to be a continuation of the former practices and procedures.\n",
      "2.2\n",
      "Muslim Period\n",
      "The Muslim period in the Indian sub-continent roughly begins in the 11th century A.D. This period\n",
      "may be divided into two parts i.e. the period of early Muslim rulers who ruled Delhi and some other\n",
      "parts of India and the Mughal period, which replaced such Muslim and other rulers in 1526 A.D. The\n",
      "Mughal Dynasty lasted until the middle of 19th century.\n",
      "During the period of Muslim rulers, the Islamic law remained the law of the land in settling civil and\n",
      "criminal disputes. However, common customs and traditions were also invoked in settling secular\n",
      "matters. These rulers were not particularly keen on applying the Islamic law to each and every sphere\n",
      "of life, and let the indigenous customs and institutions continue side by side with Islamic law and\n",
      "institutions. During this period, different courts were established and functioned at the central,\n",
      "provincial, district and tehsil (Pargana) level. These courts had defined jurisdiction in civil, criminal\n",
      "and revenue matters and operated under the authority of the King. On the top of judicial hierarchy\n",
      "was the King's Court, presided over by the King himself, exercising original as well as appellate\n",
      "jurisdiction. The King was the head of judicial administration and he made all appointments to\n",
      "judicial posts. Persons of recognised scholarship, known competence and high integrity were\n",
      "appointed to such posts. The judges held office during the pleasure of the King.\n",
      "The Mughals improved upon the previous experience and created an organised system of\n",
      "administration of justice, all over the country. Courts were created at each and every unit of the\n",
      "administrative division. At the village level, the Hindu system of Panchayats (Council of Elders) was\n",
      "retained, which decided petty disputes of civil and criminal nature, using conciliation and mediation\n",
      "as means of settling disputes. At the town level, there existed courts, presided over by\n",

      "Qazi-e-Parganah. Similarly, at the district (Sarkar) and provincial (Subah) level, courts of Qazis were\n",
      "established. The highest court at the provincial level was that of Adalat Nazim-e-Subah. Similarly, for\n",
      "revenue cases, officers known as Ameen were appointed at the town level. At the district level,\n",
      "revenue cases were dealt with by Amalguzar and at the provincial level by Diwan.\n",
      "The supreme revenue court was called, the Imperial Diwan. Side by side, with civil and revenue\n",
      "courts, criminal courts, presided over by Faujdar, Kotwal, Shiqdar and Subedar functioned.2 The\n",
      "highest court of the land was the Emperor's Court, exercising original and appellate jurisdiction.\n",
      "Although these courts generally exercised exclusive jurisdiction in different categories of cases,\n",
      "however, sometimes their jurisdiction was inter-mixed, in as much as, officers dealing with criminal\n",
      "cases were also required to act as revenue courts. Furthermore, whereas territorially, these courts\n",
      "formed a concentric organization, their jurisdiction was not always exclusive on the basis of\n",
      "territorial limits. Thus, a plaintiff may choose to file his suit in a town or a district or a province. The\n",
      "pecuniary jurisdiction of the courts was also not defined; hence, a case of higher value may be filed in\n",
      "a court of small town. Similarly, appellate jurisdiction existed but was not well defined. Thus, a\n",
      "plaintiff or a complainant, not satisfied with a decision, may file a second suit/complaint in another\n",
      "court. Such later court would decide the matter afresh, without indeed taking into consideration\n",
      "the earlier finding of the court.\n",
      "The emperor made the judicial appointments and persons of high scholarship and good reputation\n",
      "were appointed to the posts. Instructions were given to the judges to be neutral and impartial; and\n",
      "complaints against them were taken seriously. Corrupt officials were removed. Consequently, the\n",
      "scales of justice were very high.3\n",
      "The procedure followed in civil cases was not much different from the procedure, which is applicable\n",
      "today. On a suit being filed, the court summoned the opposite party to admit or deny the claim.\n",
      "Issues were framed in the presence of both the parties who were then required to produce evidence\n",
      "in support of their respective claims. Simple cases were decided, based on such evidence, however,\n",
      "in complicated cases, the judge may launch his own investigation into the matter.4 Maximum effort\n",
      "was made to find the truth. On the conclusion of the proceedings, judgment was pronounced and\n",
      "duly executed. Litigants were allowed to present their cases either personally or through agents.\n",
      "Such agents were not exactly lawyers (in the modern sense of the term) but were fully conversant\n",
      "with the judicial procedure. An officer of the court called Mufti, attached to the court, made the\n",

      "The East India Company was authorized by the Charter of 1623 to decide the cases of its English\n",
      "employees. The Company therefore established its own courts. The President and Council of the\n",
      "Company decided all cases of civil or criminal nature. The subsequent charters further expanded\n",
      "such powers. Thus, the Charter of 1661 authorized the Governor and Council to decide not only the\n",
      "cases of the Company employees but also of persons residing in the settlements. In deciding such\n",
      "cases, the Governor and the Council applied the English laws. As the character of the Company\n",
      "changed from one of a trading concern into a territorial power, newer and additional courts were\n",
      "established for deciding cases and settling disputes of its employees and subjects. The\n",
      "administration of justice was initially confined to the Presidency Town of Bombay, Calcutta and\n",
      "Madras. In view of the huge distances between these Towns and the peculiar conditions prevailing\n",
      "there, the administration of justice, which developed in these Towns, was not uniform. There were\n",
      "established two sets of courts, one for the Presidency Towns and the other for the Mufussil. The\n",
      "principal courts for the town were known as the Supreme Courts and Recorders Courts. These courts\n",
      "consisted of English judges and applied English laws. The English people, residing in such towns\n",
      "alone, were subject to their jurisdiction. The native inhabitants, who were mostly living in the\n",
      "Mufussil, were governed under separate courts called Sadar Dewani Adalat and Sadar Nizamat\n",
      "Adalat, dealing with civil and criminal cases respectively. Such courts applied the local laws and\n",
      "regulations.\n",
      "The Supreme Court of Calcutta was established under the Regulating Act 1773. The Court consisted\n",
      "of a Chief Justice and other judges, exercising both civil and criminal jurisdiction. The Court could\n",
      "also issue certain prerogative writs. In 1798, the Recorders Courts were established at Madras and\n",
      "Bombay, with powers identical to the Supreme Court of Calcutta. Afterwards, the Recorders Court at\n",
      "Madras was substituted by the Supreme Court (under the Parliament Act 1800). A few years later, the\n",
      "Recorders Court at Bombay was also replaced by the Supreme Court (under the Parliament Act\n",
      "1823). These new courts had indeed the same composition, jurisdiction and powers as exercised by\n",
      "the Supreme Court of Calcutta.\n",
      "The High Court of Judicature Act 1861 abolished the Supreme Courts as well as the Sadar Adalats,\n",
      "and in their place, constituted the High Court of Judicature for each Presidency Town. This Court\n",
      "consisted of a Chief Justice and such other number of judges, not exceeding 15. The Act prescribed\n",
      "professional qualifications for such judges together with the mode of their appointment. Thus, it\n",
      "was provided that 1/3rd of the judges should be appointed from amongst the barristers with 5 years\n",
      "standing and 1/3rd from amongst the civil servants, having 3 years experience as a District Judge.\n",
      "The remaining 1/3rd seats were filled from amongst pleaders and members of Subordinate\n",
      "Judiciary, having 5 years experience. The judges were appointed by the Crown and held office\n",
      "during his pleasure. The High Courts exercised original as well as appellate jurisdiction in civil and\n",
      "criminal matters and were also required to supervise the functioning of the Subordinate Courts in\n",
      "their respective domain. Besides the Presidency Towns, High Courts were also established in\n",
      "Allahabad in 1866, Patna in 1919, Lahore in 1919 and Rangoon in 1936. The Sindh Chief Court was\n",

      "At the village level, tribunals dispensed justice, which consisted of the assembly of the village, or the\n",
      "caste or the family.1 The village Headman acted as Judge/Magistrate for the community. Decisions\n",
      "by such tribunals were usually through conciliation. The decisions of village/town courts/tribunals\n",
      "were appealable in the higher courts and final appeal lay before the King's Court. Besides\n",

      "as to prove their respective claims. On the conclusion of the trial, decision was pronounced which\n",

      "Mughal Dynasty lasted until the middle of 19th century.\n",
      "During the period of Muslim rulers, the Islamic law remained the law of the land in settling civil and\n",
      "criminal disputes. However, common customs and traditions were also invoked in settling secular\n",
      "matters. These rulers were not particularly keen on applying the Islamic law to each and every sphere\n",
      "of life, and let the indigenous customs and institutions continue side by side with Islamic law and\n",
      "institutions. During this period, different courts were established and functioned at the central,\n",
      "provincial, district and tehsil (Pargana) level. These courts had defined jurisdiction in civil, criminal\n",
      "and revenue matters and operated under the authority of the King. On the top of judicial hierarchy\n",
      "was the King's Court, presided over by the King himself, exercising original as well as appellate\n",
      "jurisdiction. The King was the head of judicial administration and he made all appointments to\n",

      "Introduction\n",
      "\n",
      "The roots of the current judicial system of Pakistan stretch back to the medieval period and even\n",
      "before. The judicial system that we practice today has evolved over a long period of time, spanning\n",
      "roughly over a whole millennium. The system has passed through several epochs, covering the\n",
      "Hindu era, Muslim period including the Mughal Empire, British colonial period and postindependence chapter. Notwithstanding the successive changes i.e. one rule/dynasty substituted\n",
      "by the other, which naturally resulted in the socio-economic and political transformation of the\n",
      "Indian society, the judicial system generally maintained a steady growth and gradual advance\n",
      "towards consolidation and improvement/refinement, without indeed, having to undergo any major\n",
      "disruption or breakdown.\n",
      "All in all, the system experienced and passed through 3 distinct stages of historical development,\n",
      "namely, Hindu Kingdom, Muslim Rule and British Colonial Administration. The 4th and current era,\n",
      "commenced with the partition of India and the establishment of Pakistan, as a sovereign and\n",
      "independent State. The system, thus, has evolved through a process of reform and development.\n",
      "This conclusion enjoys near unanimity among historians and commentators of Indian legal history.\n",
      "During this process of evolution and growth, the judicial system did receive influences and\n",
      "inspirations from foreign doctrines/notions and indigenous norms/practices, both in terms of\n",
      "organizing courts' structure, hierarchy, jurisdiction and adopting trial procedures/practices.\n",
      "Therefore, the present judicial system is not an entirely foreign transplant, as is commonly alleged,\n",
      "but has acquired an indigenous flavour and national colour. And whereas the system may not fully\n",
      "suit the genius of our people or meet the local conditions, its continued application and practice has\n",
      "made it intelligible to the common man. The very fact that increasing number of people are\n",
      "resorting to the courts for the resolution of their conflicts/disputes, indicates that the system enjoys\n",
      "a degree of legitimacy and acceptance.\n",

      "2.1\n",
      "Hindu Period\n",
      "The Hindu period lasts for 3 millennia i.e. from 1500 BC until 1500 AD. Information on the judicial\n",
      "system during Hindu period has been somewhat sketchy, gathered mostly from scattered sources,\n",
      "such as ancient books like Dharamshastra, Smiritis and Arthashastra, and commentaries of the same\n",
      "by historians and jurists. These sources construct a well-defined system of administration of justice\n",
      "during the Hindu period. The King was regarded as the fountain of justice who also discharged\n",
      "judicial functions. In this task, judges as well as his ministers and counselors assisted him. He was the\n",
      "final judicial authority and court of ultimate appeal. At the Capital, besides the King's Court, the\n",
      "Court of Chief Justice existed. This Court, in hierarchy, was next to the King's Court and appeal\n",
      "against its decisions lay to the King's Court. The judges were appointed on the basis of their\n",
      "qualifications and scholarship but the choice was mostly restricted to upper caste i.e. Brahmins.\n",

      "\n",
      "\fThe Judicial System of Pakistan\n",
      "\n",
      "At the village level, tribunals dispensed justice, which consisted of the assembly of the village, or the\n",
      "caste or the family.1 The village Headman acted as Judge/Magistrate for the community. Decisions\n",
      "by such tribunals were usually through conciliation. The decisions of village/town courts/tribunals\n",
      "were appealable in the higher courts and final appeal lay before the King's Court. Besides\n",
      "adjudication, the system of arbitration was also in vogue.\n",
      "As regards the procedure followed in the courts/tribunals, no formal rules existed, as the law\n",
      "applicable was not statutory but customary or moral. The determination of truth and punishment of\n",
      "the wrong-doer was regarded as a religious duty. Civil proceedings commenced with the filing of a\n",
      "claim which was replied to by the opposite party. Both parties were allowed to produce witnesses so\n",
      "as to prove their respective claims. On the conclusion of the trial, decision was pronounced which\n",
      "was duly enforced. It appears thus, that the system of administration of justice, as it operated in\n",
      "ancient India, was not substantially different from what it is in the modern times. In a sense, the\n",
      "current system seems to be a continuation of the former practices and procedures.\n",
      "2.2\n",
      "Muslim Period\n",
      "The Muslim period in the Indian sub-continent roughly begins in the 11th century A.D. This period\n",
      "may be divided into two parts i.e. the period of early Muslim rulers who ruled Delhi and some other\n",
      "parts of India and the Mughal period, which replaced such Muslim and other rulers in 1526 A.D. The\n",
      "Mughal Dynasty lasted until the middle of 19th century.\n",
      "During the period of Muslim rulers, the Islamic law remained the law of the land in settling civil and\n",
      "criminal disputes. However, common customs and traditions were also invoked in settling secular\n",
      "matters. These rulers were not particularly keen on applying the Islamic law to each and every sphere\n",
      "of life, and let the indigenous customs and institutions continue side by side with Islamic law and\n",
      "institutions. During this period, different courts were established and functioned at the central,\n",
      "provincial, district and tehsil (Pargana) level. These courts had defined jurisdiction in civil, criminal\n",
      "and revenue matters and operated under the authority of the King. On the top of judicial hierarchy\n",
      "was the King's Court, presided over by the King himself, exercising original as well as appellate\n",
      "jurisdiction. The King was the head of judicial administration and he made all appointments to\n",
      "judicial posts. Persons of recognised scholarship, known competence and high integrity were\n",
      "appointed to such posts. The judges held office during the pleasure of the King.\n",
      "The Mughals improved upon the previous experience and created an organised system of\n",
      "administration of justice, all over the country. Courts were created at each and every unit of the\n",
      "administrative division. At the village level, the Hindu system of Panchayats (Council of Elders) was\n",
      "retained, which decided petty disputes of civil and criminal nature, using conciliation and mediation\n",
      "as means of settling disputes. At the town level, there existed courts, presided over by\n",

      "Qazi-e-Parganah. Similarly, at the district (Sarkar) and provincial (Subah) level, courts of Qazis were\n",
      "established. The highest court at the provincial level was that of Adalat Nazim-e-Subah. Similarly, for\n",
      "revenue cases, officers known as Ameen were appointed at the town level. At the district level,\n",
      "revenue cases were dealt with by Amalguzar and at the provincial level by Diwan.\n",
      "The supreme revenue court was called, the Imperial Diwan. Side by side, with civil and revenue\n",
      "courts, criminal courts, presided over by Faujdar, Kotwal, Shiqdar and Subedar functioned.2 The\n",
      "highest court of the land was the Emperor's Court, exercising original and appellate jurisdiction.\n",
      "Although these courts generally exercised exclusive jurisdiction in different categories of cases,\n",
      "however, sometimes their jurisdiction was inter-mixed, in as much as, officers dealing with criminal\n",
      "cases were also required to act as revenue courts. Furthermore, whereas territorially, these courts\n",
      "formed a concentric organization, their jurisdiction was not always exclusive on the basis of\n",
      "territorial limits. Thus, a plaintiff may choose to file his suit in a town or a district or a province. The\n",
      "pecuniary jurisdiction of the courts was also not defined; hence, a case of higher value may be filed in\n",
      "a court of small town. Similarly, appellate jurisdiction existed but was not well defined. Thus, a\n",
      "plaintiff or a complainant, not satisfied with a decision, may file a second suit/complaint in another\n",
      "court. Such later court would decide the matter afresh, without indeed taking into consideration\n",
      "the earlier finding of the court.\n",
      "The emperor made the judicial appointments and persons of high scholarship and good reputation\n",
      "were appointed to the posts. Instructions were given to the judges to be neutral and impartial; and\n",
      "complaints against them were taken seriously. Corrupt officials were removed. Consequently, the\n",
      "scales of justice were very high.3\n",
      "The procedure followed in civil cases was not much different from the procedure, which is applicable\n",
      "today. On a suit being filed, the court summoned the opposite party to admit or deny the claim.\n",
      "Issues were framed in the presence of both the parties who were then required to produce evidence\n",
      "in support of their respective claims. Simple cases were decided, based on such evidence, however,\n",
      "in complicated cases, the judge may launch his own investigation into the matter.4 Maximum effort\n",
      "was made to find the truth. On the conclusion of the proceedings, judgment was pronounced and\n",
      "duly executed. Litigants were allowed to present their cases either personally or through agents.\n",
      "Such agents were not exactly lawyers (in the modern sense of the term) but were fully conversant\n",
      "with the judicial procedure. An officer of the court called Mufti, attached to the court, made the\n",

      "employees. The Company therefore established its own courts. The President and Council of the\n",
      "Company decided all cases of civil or criminal nature. The subsequent charters further expanded\n",
      "such powers. Thus, the Charter of 1661 authorized the Governor and Council to decide not only the\n",
      "cases of the Company employees but also of persons residing in the settlements. In deciding such\n",
      "cases, the Governor and the Council applied the English laws. As the character of the Company\n",
      "changed from one of a trading concern into a territorial power, newer and additional courts were\n",
      "established for deciding cases and settling disputes of its employees and subjects. The\n",
      "administration of justice was initially confined to the Presidency Town of Bombay, Calcutta and\n",

      "there, the administration of justice, which developed in these Towns, was not uniform. There were\n",
      "established two sets of courts, one for the Presidency Towns and the other for the Mufussil. The\n",
      "principal courts for the town were known as the Supreme Courts and Recorders Courts. These courts\n",
      "consisted of English judges and applied English laws. The English people, residing in such towns\n",

      "Mufussil, were governed under separate courts called Sadar Dewani Adalat and Sadar Nizamat\n",
      "Adalat, dealing with civil and criminal cases respectively. Such courts applied the local laws and\n",
      "regulations.\n",
      "The Supreme Court of Calcutta was established under the Regulating Act 1773. The Court consisted\n",
      "of a Chief Justice and other judges, exercising both civil and criminal jurisdiction. The Court could\n",
      "also issue certain prerogative writs. In 1798, the Recorders Courts were established at Madras and\n",
      "Bombay, with powers identical to the Supreme Court of Calcutta. Afterwards, the Recorders Court at\n",
      "Madras was substituted by the Supreme Court (under the Parliament Act 1800). A few years later, the\n",
      "Recorders Court at Bombay was also replaced by the Supreme Court (under the Parliament Act\n",

      "and in their place, constituted the High Court of Judicature for each Presidency Town. This Court\n",
      "consisted of a Chief Justice and such other number of judges, not exceeding 15. The Act prescribed\n",

      "Introduction\n",
      "\n",
      "The roots of the current judicial system of Pakistan stretch back to the medieval period and even\n",
      "before. The judicial system that we practice today has evolved over a long period of time, spanning\n",
      "roughly over a whole millennium. The system has passed through several epochs, covering the\n",
      "Hindu era, Muslim period including the Mughal Empire, British colonial period and postindependence chapter. Notwithstanding the successive changes i.e. one rule/dynasty substituted\n",
      "by the other, which naturally resulted in the socio-economic and political transformation of the\n",
      "Indian society, the judicial system generally maintained a steady growth and gradual advance\n",
      "towards consolidation and improvement/refinement, without indeed, having to undergo any major\n",
      "disruption or breakdown.\n",
      "All in all, the system experienced and passed through 3 distinct stages of historical development,\n",
      "namely, Hindu Kingdom, Muslim Rule and British Colonial Administration. The 4th and current era,\n",
      "commenced with the partition of India and the establishment of Pakistan, as a sovereign and\n",
      "independent State. The system, thus, has evolved through a process of reform and development.\n",
      "This conclusion enjoys near unanimity among historians and commentators of Indian legal history.\n",
      "During this process of evolution and growth, the judicial system did receive influences and\n",
      "inspirations from foreign doctrines/notions and indigenous norms/practices, both in terms of\n",
      "organizing courts' structure, hierarchy, jurisdiction and adopting trial procedures/practices.\n",
      "Therefore, the present judicial system is not an entirely foreign transplant, as is commonly alleged,\n",
      "but has acquired an indigenous flavour and national colour. And whereas the system may not fully\n",
      "suit the genius of our people or meet the local conditions, its continued application and practice has\n",
      "made it intelligible to the common man. The very fact that increasing number of people are\n",
      "resorting to the courts for the resolution of their conflicts/disputes, indicates that the system enjoys\n",
      "a degree of legitimacy and acceptance.\n",

      "Historical Retrospect\n",

      "2.1\n",
      "Hindu Period\n",
      "The Hindu period lasts for 3 millennia i.e. from 1500 BC until 1500 AD. Information on the judicial\n",
      "system during Hindu period has been somewhat sketchy, gathered mostly from scattered sources,\n",
      "such as ancient books like Dharamshastra, Smiritis and Arthashastra, and commentaries of the same\n",
      "by historians and jurists. These sources construct a well-defined system of administration of justice\n",
      "during the Hindu period. The King was regarded as the fountain of justice who also discharged\n",
      "judicial functions. In this task, judges as well as his ministers and counselors assisted him. He was the\n",
      "final judicial authority and court of ultimate appeal. At the Capital, besides the King's Court, the\n",
      "Court of Chief Justice existed. This Court, in hierarchy, was next to the King's Court and appeal\n",
      "against its decisions lay to the King's Court. The judges were appointed on the basis of their\n",
      "qualifications and scholarship but the choice was mostly restricted to upper caste i.e. Brahmins.\n",
      "\n",
      "1\n",
      "\n",
      "\fThe Judicial System of Pakistan\n",
      "\n",
      "At the village level, tribunals dispensed justice, which consisted of the assembly of the village, or the\n",
      "caste or the family.1 The village Headman acted as Judge/Magistrate for the community. Decisions\n",
      "by such tribunals were usually through conciliation. The decisions of village/town courts/tribunals\n",
      "were appealable in the higher courts and final appeal lay before the King's Court. Besides\n",
      "adjudication, the system of arbitration was also in vogue.\n",
      "As regards the procedure followed in the courts/tribunals, no formal rules existed, as the law\n",
      "applicable was not statutory but customary or moral. The determination of truth and punishment of\n",
      "the wrong-doer was regarded as a religious duty. Civil proceedings commenced with the filing of a\n",
      "claim which was replied to by the opposite party. Both parties were allowed to produce witnesses so\n",
      "as to prove their respective claims. On the conclusion of the trial, decision was pronounced which\n",
      "was duly enforced. It appears thus, that the system of administration of justice, as it operated in\n",
      "ancient India, was not substantially different from what it is in the modern times. In a sense, the\n",
      "current system seems to be a continuation of the former practices and procedures.\n",
      "2.2\n",
      "Muslim Period\n",
      "The Muslim period in the Indian sub-continent roughly begins in the 11th century A.D. This period\n",
      "may be divided into two parts i.e. the period of early Muslim rulers who ruled Delhi and some other\n",
      "parts of India and the Mughal period, which replaced such Muslim and other rulers in 1526 A.D. The\n",
      "Mughal Dynasty lasted until the middle of 19th century.\n",
      "During the period of Muslim rulers, the Islamic law remained the law of the land in settling civil and\n",
      "criminal disputes. However, common customs and traditions were also invoked in settling secular\n",
      "matters. These rulers were not particularly keen on applying the Islamic law to each and every sphere\n",
      "of life, and let the indigenous customs and institutions continue side by side with Islamic law and\n",
      "institutions. During this period, different courts were established and functioned at the central,\n",
      "provincial, district and tehsil (Pargana) level. These courts had defined jurisdiction in civil, criminal\n",
      "and revenue matters and operated under the authority of the King. On the top of judicial hierarchy\n",
      "was the King's Court, presided over by the King himself, exercising original as well as appellate\n",
      "jurisdiction. The King was the head of judicial administration and he made all appointments to\n",
      "judicial posts. Persons of recognised scholarship, known competence and high integrity were\n",
      "appointed to such posts. The judges held office during the pleasure of the King.\n",
      "The Mughals improved upon the previous experience and created an organised system of\n",
      "administration of justice, all over the country. Courts were created at each and every unit of the\n",
      "administrative division. At the village level, the Hindu system of Panchayats (Council of Elders) was\n",
      "retained, which decided petty disputes of civil and criminal nature, using conciliation and mediation\n",
      "as means of settling disputes. At the town level, there existed courts, presided over by\n",

      "Qazi-e-Parganah. Similarly, at the district (Sarkar) and provincial (Subah) level, courts of Qazis were\n",
      "established. The highest court at the provincial level was that of Adalat Nazim-e-Subah. Similarly, for\n",
      "revenue cases, officers known as Ameen were appointed at the town level. At the district level,\n",
      "revenue cases were dealt with by Amalguzar and at the provincial level by Diwan.\n",
      "The supreme revenue court was called, the Imperial Diwan. Side by side, with civil and revenue\n",
      "courts, criminal courts, presided over by Faujdar, Kotwal, Shiqdar and Subedar functioned.2 The\n",
      "highest court of the land was the Emperor's Court, exercising original and appellate jurisdiction.\n",
      "Although these courts generally exercised exclusive jurisdiction in different categories of cases,\n",
      "however, sometimes their jurisdiction was inter-mixed, in as much as, officers dealing with criminal\n",
      "cases were also required to act as revenue courts. Furthermore, whereas territorially, these courts\n",
      "formed a concentric organization, their jurisdiction was not always exclusive on the basis of\n",
      "territorial limits. Thus, a plaintiff may choose to file his suit in a town or a district or a province. The\n",
      "pecuniary jurisdiction of the courts was also not defined; hence, a case of higher value may be filed in\n",
      "a court of small town. Similarly, appellate jurisdiction existed but was not well defined. Thus, a\n",
      "plaintiff or a complainant, not satisfied with a decision, may file a second suit/complaint in another\n",
      "court. Such later court would decide the matter afresh, without indeed taking into consideration\n",
      "the earlier finding of the court.\n",
      "The emperor made the judicial appointments and persons of high scholarship and good reputation\n",
      "were appointed to the posts. Instructions were given to the judges to be neutral and impartial; and\n",
      "complaints against them were taken seriously. Corrupt officials were removed. Consequently, the\n",
      "scales of justice were very high.3\n",
      "The procedure followed in civil cases was not much different from the procedure, which is applicable\n",
      "today. On a suit being filed, the court summoned the opposite party to admit or deny the claim.\n",
      "Issues were framed in the presence of both the parties who were then required to produce evidence\n",
      "in support of their respective claims. Simple cases were decided, based on such evidence, however,\n",
      "in complicated cases, the judge may launch his own investigation into the matter.4 Maximum effort\n",
      "was made to find the truth. On the conclusion of the proceedings, judgment was pronounced and\n",
      "duly executed. Litigants were allowed to present their cases either personally or through agents.\n",
      "Such agents were not exactly lawyers (in the modern sense of the term) but were fully conversant\n",
      "with the judicial procedure. An officer of the court called Mufti, attached to the court, made the\n",

      "British Period\n",
      "The East India Company was authorized by the Charter of 1623 to decide the cases of its English\n",
      "employees. The Company therefore established its own courts. The President and Council of the\n",
      "Company decided all cases of civil or criminal nature. The subsequent charters further expanded\n",
      "such powers. Thus, the Charter of 1661 authorized the Governor and Council to decide not only the\n",
      "cases of the Company employees but also of persons residing in the settlements. In deciding such\n",
      "cases, the Governor and the Council applied the English laws. As the character of the Company\n",
      "changed from one of a trading concern into a territorial power, newer and additional courts were\n",
      "established for deciding cases and settling disputes of its employees and subjects. The\n",
      "administration of justice was initially confined to the Presidency Town of Bombay, Calcutta and\n",
      "Madras. In view of the huge distances between these Towns and the peculiar conditions prevailing\n",
      "there, the administration of justice, which developed in these Towns, was not uniform. There were\n",
      "established two sets of courts, one for the Presidency Towns and the other for the Mufussil. The\n",
      "principal courts for the town were known as the Supreme Courts and Recorders Courts. These courts\n",
      "consisted of English judges and applied English laws. The English people, residing in such towns\n",
      "alone, were subject to their jurisdiction. The native inhabitants, who were mostly living in the\n",
      "Mufussil, were governed under separate courts called Sadar Dewani Adalat and Sadar Nizamat\n",
      "Adalat, dealing with civil and criminal cases respectively. Such courts applied the local laws and\n",
      "regulations.\n",
      "The Supreme Court of Calcutta was established under the Regulating Act 1773. The Court consisted\n",
      "of a Chief Justice and other judges, exercising both civil and criminal jurisdiction. The Court could\n",
      "also issue certain prerogative writs. In 1798, the Recorders Courts were established at Madras and\n",
      "Bombay, with powers identical to the Supreme Court of Calcutta. Afterwards, the Recorders Court at\n",
      "Madras was substituted by the Supreme Court (under the Parliament Act 1800). A few years later, the\n",
      "Recorders Court at Bombay was also replaced by the Supreme Court (under the Parliament Act\n",
      "1823). These new courts had indeed the same composition, jurisdiction and powers as exercised by\n",
      "the Supreme Court of Calcutta.\n",
      "The High Court of Judicature Act 1861 abolished the Supreme Courts as well as the Sadar Adalats,\n",
      "and in their place, constituted the High Court of Judicature for each Presidency Town. This Court\n",
      "consisted of a Chief Justice and such other number of judges, not exceeding 15. The Act prescribed\n",
      "professional qualifications for such judges together with the mode of their appointment. Thus, it\n",
      "was provided that 1/3rd of the judges should be appointed from amongst the barristers with 5 years\n",
      "standing and 1/3rd from amongst the civil servants, having 3 years experience as a District Judge.\n",
      "The remaining 1/3rd seats were filled from amongst pleaders and members of Subordinate\n",
      "Judiciary, having 5 years experience. The judges were appointed by the Crown and held office\n",
      "during his pleasure. The High Courts exercised original as well as appellate jurisdiction in civil and\n",
      "criminal matters and were also required to supervise the functioning of the Subordinate Courts in\n",
      "their respective domain. Besides the Presidency Towns, High Courts were also established in\n",

      "Introduction\n",
      "\n",
      "The roots of the current judicial system of Pakistan stretch back to the medieval period and even\n",
      "before. The judicial system that we practice today has evolved over a long period of time, spanning\n",
      "roughly over a whole millennium. The system has passed through several epochs, covering the\n",
      "Hindu era, Muslim period including the Mughal Empire, British colonial period and postindependence chapter. Notwithstanding the successive changes i.e. one rule/dynasty substituted\n",
      "by the other, which naturally resulted in the socio-economic and political transformation of the\n",
      "Indian society, the judicial system generally maintained a steady growth and gradual advance\n",
      "towards consolidation and improvement/refinement, without indeed, having to undergo any major\n",
      "disruption or breakdown.\n",
      "All in all, the system experienced and passed through 3 distinct stages of historical development,\n",
      "namely, Hindu Kingdom, Muslim Rule and British Colonial Administration. The 4th and current era,\n",
      "commenced with the partition of India and the establishment of Pakistan, as a sovereign and\n",
      "independent State. The system, thus, has evolved through a process of reform and development.\n",
      "This conclusion enjoys near unanimity among historians and commentators of Indian legal history.\n",
      "During this process of evolution and growth, the judicial system did receive influences and\n",
      "inspirations from foreign doctrines/notions and indigenous norms/practices, both in terms of\n",
      "organizing courts' structure, hierarchy, jurisdiction and adopting trial procedures/practices.\n",
      "Therefore, the present judicial system is not an entirely foreign transplant, as is commonly alleged,\n",
      "but has acquired an indigenous flavour and national colour. And whereas the system may not fully\n",
      "suit the genius of our people or meet the local conditions, its continued application and practice has\n",
      "made it intelligible to the common man. The very fact that increasing number of people are\n",
      "resorting to the courts for the resolution of their conflicts/disputes, indicates that the system enjoys\n",
      "a degree of legitimacy and acceptance.\n",

      "Historical Retrospect\n",

      "2.1\n",
      "Hindu Period\n",
      "The Hindu period lasts for 3 millennia i.e. from 1500 BC until 1500 AD. Information on the judicial\n",
      "system during Hindu period has been somewhat sketchy, gathered mostly from scattered sources,\n",
      "such as ancient books like Dharamshastra, Smiritis and Arthashastra, and commentaries of the same\n",
      "by historians and jurists. These sources construct a well-defined system of administration of justice\n",
      "during the Hindu period. The King was regarded as the fountain of justice who also discharged\n",
      "judicial functions. In this task, judges as well as his ministers and counselors assisted him. He was the\n",
      "final judicial authority and court of ultimate appeal. At the Capital, besides the King's Court, the\n",
      "Court of Chief Justice existed. This Court, in hierarchy, was next to the King's Court and appeal\n",
      "against its decisions lay to the King's Court. The judges were appointed on the basis of their\n",
      "qualifications and scholarship but the choice was mostly restricted to upper caste i.e. Brahmins.\n",
      "\n",
      "1\n",
      "\n",
      "\fThe Judicial System of Pakistan\n",
      "\n",
      "At the village level, tribunals dispensed justice, which consisted of the assembly of the village, or the\n",
      "caste or the family.1 The village Headman acted as Judge/Magistrate for the community. Decisions\n",
      "by such tribunals were usually through conciliation. The decisions of village/town courts/tribunals\n",
      "were appealable in the higher courts and final appeal lay before the King's Court. Besides\n",
      "adjudication, the system of arbitration was also in vogue.\n",
      "As regards the procedure followed in the courts/tribunals, no formal rules existed, as the law\n",
      "applicable was not statutory but customary or moral. The determination of truth and punishment of\n",
      "the wrong-doer was regarded as a religious duty. Civil proceedings commenced with the filing of a\n",
      "claim which was replied to by the opposite party. Both parties were allowed to produce witnesses so\n",
      "as to prove their respective claims. On the conclusion of the trial, decision was pronounced which\n",
      "was duly enforced. It appears thus, that the system of administration of justice, as it operated in\n",
      "ancient India, was not substantially different from what it is in the modern times. In a sense, the\n",
      "current system seems to be a continuation of the former practices and procedures.\n",
      "2.2\n",
      "Muslim Period\n",
      "The Muslim period in the Indian sub-continent roughly begins in the 11th century A.D. This period\n",
      "may be divided into two parts i.e. the period of early Muslim rulers who ruled Delhi and some other\n",
      "parts of India and the Mughal period, which replaced such Muslim and other rulers in 1526 A.D. The\n",
      "Mughal Dynasty lasted until the middle of 19th century.\n",
      "During the period of Muslim rulers, the Islamic law remained the law of the land in settling civil and\n",
      "criminal disputes. However, common customs and traditions were also invoked in settling secular\n",
      "matters. These rulers were not particularly keen on applying the Islamic law to each and every sphere\n",
      "of life, and let the indigenous customs and institutions continue side by side with Islamic law and\n",
      "institutions. During this period, different courts were established and functioned at the central,\n",
      "provincial, district and tehsil (Pargana) level. These courts had defined jurisdiction in civil, criminal\n",
      "and revenue matters and operated under the authority of the King. On the top of judicial hierarchy\n",
      "was the King's Court, presided over by the King himself, exercising original as well as appellate\n",
      "jurisdiction. The King was the head of judicial administration and he made all appointments to\n",
      "judicial posts. Persons of recognised scholarship, known competence and high integrity were\n",
      "appointed to such posts. The judges held office during the pleasure of the King.\n",
      "The Mughals improved upon the previous experience and created an organised system of\n",
      "administration of justice, all over the country. Courts were created at each and every unit of the\n",
      "administrative division. At the village level, the Hindu system of Panchayats (Council of Elders) was\n",
      "retained, which decided petty disputes of civil and criminal nature, using conciliation and mediation\n",
      "as means of settling disputes. At the town level, there existed courts, presided over by\n",

      "Qazi-e-Parganah. Similarly, at the district (Sarkar) and provincial (Subah) level, courts of Qazis were\n",
      "established. The highest court at the provincial level was that of Adalat Nazim-e-Subah. Similarly, for\n",
      "revenue cases, officers known as Ameen were appointed at the town level. At the district level,\n",
      "revenue cases were dealt with by Amalguzar and at the provincial level by Diwan.\n",
      "The supreme revenue court was called, the Imperial Diwan. Side by side, with civil and revenue\n",
      "courts, criminal courts, presided over by Faujdar, Kotwal, Shiqdar and Subedar functioned.2 The\n",
      "highest court of the land was the Emperor's Court, exercising original and appellate jurisdiction.\n",
      "Although these courts generally exercised exclusive jurisdiction in different categories of cases,\n",
      "however, sometimes their jurisdiction was inter-mixed, in as much as, officers dealing with criminal\n",
      "cases were also required to act as revenue courts. Furthermore, whereas territorially, these courts\n",
      "formed a concentric organization, their jurisdiction was not always exclusive on the basis of\n",
      "territorial limits. Thus, a plaintiff may choose to file his suit in a town or a district or a province. The\n",
      "pecuniary jurisdiction of the courts was also not defined; hence, a case of higher value may be filed in\n",
      "a court of small town. Similarly, appellate jurisdiction existed but was not well defined. Thus, a\n",

      "\n",
      "The roots of the current judicial system of Pakistan stretch back to the medieval period and even\n",
      "before. The judicial system that we practice today has evolved over a long period of time, spanning\n",
      "roughly over a whole millennium. The system has passed through several epochs, covering the\n",
      "Hindu era, Muslim period including the Mughal Empire, British colonial period and postindependence chapter. Notwithstanding the successive changes i.e. one rule/dynasty substituted\n",
      "by the other, which naturally resulted in the socio-economic and political transformation of the\n",
      "Indian society, the judicial system generally maintained a steady growth and gradual advance\n",
      "towards consolidation and improvement/refinement, without indeed, having to undergo any major\n",
      "disruption or breakdown.\n",
      "All in all, the system experienced and passed through 3 distinct stages of historical development,\n",
      "namely, Hindu Kingdom, Muslim Rule and British Colonial Administration. The 4th and current era,\n",
      "commenced with the partition of India and the establishment of Pakistan, as a sovereign and\n",
      "independent State. The system, thus, has evolved through a process of reform and development.\n",
      "This conclusion enjoys near unanimity among historians and commentators of Indian legal history.\n",
      "During this process of evolution and growth, the judicial system did receive influences and\n",
      "inspirations from foreign doctrines/notions and indigenous norms/practices, both in terms of\n",
      "organizing courts' structure, hierarchy, jurisdiction and adopting trial procedures/practices.\n",
      "Therefore, the present judicial system is not an entirely foreign transplant, as is commonly alleged,\n",
      "but has acquired an indigenous flavour and national colour. And whereas the system may not fully\n",
      "suit the genius of our people or meet the local conditions, its continued application and practice has\n",
      "made it intelligible to the common man. The very fact that increasing number of people are\n",
      "resorting to the courts for the resolution of their conflicts/disputes, indicates that the system enjoys\n",
      "a degree of legitimacy and acceptance.\n",

      "Hindu Period\n",

      "At the village level, tribunals dispensed justice, which consisted of the assembly of the village, or the\n",
      "caste or the family.1 The village Headman acted as Judge/Magistrate for the community. Decisions\n",
      "by such tribunals were usually through conciliation. The decisions of village/town courts/tribunals\n",
      "were appealable in the higher courts and final appeal lay before the King's Court. Besides\n",
      "adjudication, the system of arbitration was also in vogue.\n",
      "As regards the procedure followed in the courts/tribunals, no formal rules existed, as the law\n",
      "applicable was not statutory but customary or moral. The determination of truth and punishment of\n",
      "the wrong-doer was regarded as a religious duty. Civil proceedings commenced with the filing of a\n",
      "claim which was replied to by the opposite party. Both parties were allowed to produce witnesses so\n",
      "as to prove their respective claims. On the conclusion of the trial, decision was pronounced which\n",
      "was duly enforced. It appears thus, that the system of administration of justice, as it operated in\n",
      "ancient India, was not substantially different from what it is in the modern times. In a sense, the\n",

      "may be divided into two parts i.e. the period of early Muslim rulers who ruled Delhi and some other\n",
      "parts of India and the Mughal period, which replaced such Muslim and other rulers in 1526 A.D. The\n",
      "Mughal Dynasty lasted until the middle of 19th century.\n",
      "During the period of Muslim rulers, the Islamic law remained the law of the land in settling civil and\n",
      "criminal disputes. However, common customs and traditions were also invoked in settling secular\n",
      "matters. These rulers were not particularly keen on applying the Islamic law to each and every sphere\n",
      "of life, and let the indigenous customs and institutions continue side by side with Islamic law and\n",
      "institutions. During this period, different courts were established and functioned at the central,\n",
      "provincial, district and tehsil (Pargana) level. These courts had defined jurisdiction in civil, criminal\n",
      "and revenue matters and operated under the authority of the King. On the top of judicial hierarchy\n",
      "was the King's Court, presided over by the King himself, exercising original as well as appellate\n",
      "jurisdiction. The King was the head of judicial administration and he made all appointments to\n",
      "judicial posts. Persons of recognised scholarship, known competence and high integrity were\n",
      "appointed to such posts. The judges held office during the pleasure of the King.\n",
      "The Mughals improved upon the previous experience and created an organised system of\n",
      "administration of justice, all over the country. Courts were created at each and every unit of the\n",

      "Introduction\n",
      "\n",
      "The roots of the current judicial system of Pakistan stretch back to the medieval period and even\n",
      "before. The judicial system that we practice today has evolved over a long period of time, spanning\n",
      "roughly over a whole millennium. The system has passed through several epochs, covering the\n",
      "Hindu era, Muslim period including the Mughal Empire, British colonial period and postindependence chapter. Notwithstanding the successive changes i.e. one rule/dynasty substituted\n",
      "by the other, which naturally resulted in the socio-economic and political transformation of the\n",
      "Indian society, the judicial system generally maintained a steady growth and gradual advance\n",
      "towards consolidation and improvement/refinement, without indeed, having to undergo any major\n",
      "disruption or breakdown.\n",
      "All in all, the system experienced and passed through 3 distinct stages of historical development,\n",
      "namely, Hindu Kingdom, Muslim Rule and British Colonial Administration. The 4th and current era,\n",
      "commenced with the partition of India and the establishment of Pakistan, as a sovereign and\n",
      "independent State. The system, thus, has evolved through a process of reform and development.\n",
      "This conclusion enjoys near unanimity among historians and commentators of Indian legal history.\n",
      "During this process of evolution and growth, the judicial system did receive influences and\n",
      "inspirations from foreign doctrines/notions and indigenous norms/practices, both in terms of\n",
      "organizing courts' structure, hierarchy, jurisdiction and adopting trial procedures/practices.\n",
      "Therefore, the present judicial system is not an entirely foreign transplant, as is commonly alleged,\n",
      "but has acquired an indigenous flavour and national colour. And whereas the system may not fully\n",
      "suit the genius of our people or meet the local conditions, its continued application and practice has\n",
      "made it intelligible to the common man. The very fact that increasing number of people are\n",
      "resorting to the courts for the resolution of their conflicts/disputes, indicates that the system enjoys\n",
      "a degree of legitimacy and acceptance.\n",

      "Historical Retrospect\n",
      "\n",
      "2.1\n",
      "Hindu Period\n",
      "The Hindu period lasts for 3 millennia i.e. from 1500 BC until 1500 AD. Information on the judicial\n",
      "system during Hindu period has been somewhat sketchy, gathered mostly from scattered sources,\n",
      "such as ancient books like Dharamshastra, Smiritis and Arthashastra, and commentaries of the same\n",
      "by historians and jurists. These sources construct a well-defined system of administration of justice\n",
      "during the Hindu period. The King was regarded as the fountain of justice who also discharged\n",
      "judicial functions. In this task, judges as well as his ministers and counselors assisted him. He was the\n",
      "final judicial authority and court of ultimate appeal. At the Capital, besides the King's Court, the\n",
      "Court of Chief Justice existed. This Court, in hierarchy, was next to the King's Court and appeal\n",
      "against its decisions lay to the King's Court. The judges were appointed on the basis of their\n",
      "qualifications and scholarship but the choice was mostly restricted to upper caste i.e. Brahmins.\n",
      "\n",
      "1\n",
      "\n",
      "\fThe Judicial System of Pakistan\n",
      "\n",
      "At the village level, tribunals dispensed justice, which consisted of the assembly of the village, or the\n",
      "caste or the family.1 The village Headman acted as Judge/Magistrate for the community. Decisions\n",
      "by such tribunals were usually through conciliation. The decisions of village/town courts/tribunals\n",
      "were appealable in the higher courts and final appeal lay before the King's Court. Besides\n",
      "adjudication, the system of arbitration was also in vogue.\n",
      "As regards the procedure followed in the courts/tribunals, no formal rules existed, as the law\n",
      "applicable was not statutory but customary or moral. The determination of truth and punishment of\n",
      "the wrong-doer was regarded as a religious duty. Civil proceedings commenced with the filing of a\n",
      "claim which was replied to by the opposite party. Both parties were allowed to produce witnesses so\n",
      "as to prove their respective claims. On the conclusion of the trial, decision was pronounced which\n",
      "was duly enforced. It appears thus, that the system of administration of justice, as it operated in\n",
      "ancient India, was not substantially different from what it is in the modern times. In a sense, the\n",
      "current system seems to be a continuation of the former practices and procedures.\n",
      "2.2\n",
      "Muslim Period\n",
      "The Muslim period in the Indian sub-continent roughly begins in the 11th century A.D. This period\n",
      "may be divided into two parts i.e. the period of early Muslim rulers who ruled Delhi and some other\n",
      "parts of India and the Mughal period, which replaced such Muslim and other rulers in 1526 A.D. The\n",
      "Mughal Dynasty lasted until the middle of 19th century.\n",
      "During the period of Muslim rulers, the Islamic law remained the law of the land in settling civil and\n",
      "criminal disputes. However, common customs and traditions were also invoked in settling secular\n",
      "matters. These rulers were not particularly keen on applying the Islamic law to each and every sphere\n",
      "of life, and let the indigenous customs and institutions continue side by side with Islamic law and\n",
      "institutions. During this period, different courts were established and functioned at the central,\n",
      "provincial, district and tehsil (Pargana) level. These courts had defined jurisdiction in civil, criminal\n",
      "and revenue matters and operated under the authority of the King. On the top of judicial hierarchy\n",
      "was the King's Court, presided over by the King himself, exercising original as well as appellate\n",
      "jurisdiction. The King was the head of judicial administration and he made all appointments to\n",
      "judicial posts. Persons of recognised scholarship, known competence and high integrity were\n",
      "appointed to such posts. The judges held office during the pleasure of the King.\n",
      "The Mughals improved upon the previous experience and created an organised system of\n",
      "administration of justice, all over the country. Courts were created at each and every unit of the\n",
      "administrative division. At the village level, the Hindu system of Panchayats (Council of Elders) was\n",
      "retained, which decided petty disputes of civil and criminal nature, using conciliation and mediation\n",
      "as means of settling disputes. At the town level, there existed courts, presided over by\n",

      "Qazi-e-Parganah. Similarly, at the district (Sarkar) and provincial (Subah) level, courts of Qazis were\n",
      "established. The highest court at the provincial level was that of Adalat Nazim-e-Subah. Similarly, for\n",
      "revenue cases, officers known as Ameen were appointed at the town level. At the district level,\n",
      "revenue cases were dealt with by Amalguzar and at the provincial level by Diwan.\n",
      "The supreme revenue court was called, the Imperial Diwan. Side by side, with civil and revenue\n",
      "courts, criminal courts, presided over by Faujdar, Kotwal, Shiqdar and Subedar functioned.2 The\n",
      "highest court of the land was the Emperor's Court, exercising original and appellate jurisdiction.\n",
      "Although these courts generally exercised exclusive jurisdiction in different categories of cases,\n",
      "however, sometimes their jurisdiction was inter-mixed, in as much as, officers dealing with criminal\n",
      "cases were also required to act as revenue courts. Furthermore, whereas territorially, these courts\n",
      "formed a concentric organization, their jurisdiction was not always exclusive on the basis of\n",
      "territorial limits. Thus, a plaintiff may choose to file his suit in a town or a district or a province. The\n",
      "pecuniary jurisdiction of the courts was also not defined; hence, a case of higher value may be filed in\n",
      "a court of small town. Similarly, appellate jurisdiction existed but was not well defined. Thus, a\n",
      "plaintiff or a complainant, not satisfied with a decision, may file a second suit/complaint in another\n",
      "court. Such later court would decide the matter afresh, without indeed taking into consideration\n",
      "the earlier finding of the court.\n",
      "The emperor made the judicial appointments and persons of high scholarship and good reputation\n",
      "were appointed to the posts. Instructions were given to the judges to be neutral and impartial; and\n",
      "complaints against them were taken seriously. Corrupt officials were removed. Consequently, the\n",
      "scales of justice were very high.3\n",
      "The procedure followed in civil cases was not much different from the procedure, which is applicable\n",
      "today. On a suit being filed, the court summoned the opposite party to admit or deny the claim.\n",
      "Issues were framed in the presence of both the parties who were then required to produce evidence\n",
      "in support of their respective claims. Simple cases were decided, based on such evidence, however,\n",
      "in complicated cases, the judge may launch his own investigation into the matter.4 Maximum effort\n",
      "was made to find the truth. On the conclusion of the proceedings, judgment was pronounced and\n",
      "duly executed. Litigants were allowed to present their cases either personally or through agents.\n",
      "Such agents were not exactly lawyers (in the modern sense of the term) but were fully conversant\n",
      "with the judicial procedure. An officer of the court called Mufti, attached to the court, made the\n",

      "Company decided all cases of civil or criminal nature. The subsequent charters further expanded\n",

      "changed from one of a trading concern into a territorial power, newer and additional courts were\n",
      "established for deciding cases and settling disputes of its employees and subjects. The\n",

      "The Supreme Court of Calcutta was established under the Regulating Act 1773. The Court consisted\n",
      "of a Chief Justice and other judges, exercising both civil and criminal jurisdiction. The Court could\n",
      "also issue certain prerogative writs. In 1798, the Recorders Courts were established at Madras and\n",

      "Introduction\n",
      "\n",
      "The roots of the current judicial system of Pakistan stretch back to the medieval period and even\n",
      "before. The judicial system that we practice today has evolved over a long period of time, spanning\n",
      "roughly over a whole millennium. The system has passed through several epochs, covering the\n",
      "Hindu era, Muslim period including the Mughal Empire, British colonial period and postindependence chapter. Notwithstanding the successive changes i.e. one rule/dynasty substituted\n",
      "by the other, which naturally resulted in the socio-economic and political transformation of the\n",
      "Indian society, the judicial system generally maintained a steady growth and gradual advance\n",
      "towards consolidation and improvement/refinement, without indeed, having to undergo any major\n",
      "disruption or breakdown.\n",
      "All in all, the system experienced and passed through 3 distinct stages of historical development,\n",
      "namely, Hindu Kingdom, Muslim Rule and British Colonial Administration. The 4th and current era,\n",
      "commenced with the partition of India and the establishment of Pakistan, as a sovereign and\n",
      "independent State. The system, thus, has evolved through a process of reform and development.\n",
      "This conclusion enjoys near unanimity among historians and commentators of Indian legal history.\n",
      "During this process of evolution and growth, the judicial system did receive influences and\n",
      "inspirations from foreign doctrines/notions and indigenous norms/practices, both in terms of\n",
      "organizing courts' structure, hierarchy, jurisdiction and adopting trial procedures/practices.\n",
      "Therefore, the present judicial system is not an entirely foreign transplant, as is commonly alleged,\n",
      "but has acquired an indigenous flavour and national colour. And whereas the system may not fully\n",
      "suit the genius of our people or meet the local conditions, its continued application and practice has\n",
      "made it intelligible to the common man. The very fact that increasing number of people are\n",
      "resorting to the courts for the resolution of their conflicts/disputes, indicates that the system enjoys\n",
      "a degree of legitimacy and acceptance.\n",

      "2.1\n",
      "Hindu Period\n",
      "The Hindu period lasts for 3 millennia i.e. from 1500 BC until 1500 AD. Information on the judicial\n",
      "system during Hindu period has been somewhat sketchy, gathered mostly from scattered sources,\n",
      "such as ancient books like Dharamshastra, Smiritis and Arthashastra, and commentaries of the same\n",
      "by historians and jurists. These sources construct a well-defined system of administration of justice\n",
      "during the Hindu period. The King was regarded as the fountain of justice who also discharged\n",
      "judicial functions. In this task, judges as well as his ministers and counselors assisted him. He was the\n",
      "final judicial authority and court of ultimate appeal. At the Capital, besides the King's Court, the\n",
      "Court of Chief Justice existed. This Court, in hierarchy, was next to the King's Court and appeal\n",
      "against its decisions lay to the King's Court. The judges were appointed on the basis of their\n",
      "qualifications and scholarship but the choice was mostly restricted to upper caste i.e. Brahmins.\n",
      "\n",
      "1\n",
      "\n",
      "\fThe Judicial System of Pakistan\n",
      "\n",
      "At the village level, tribunals dispensed justice, which consisted of the assembly of the village, or the\n",
      "caste or the family.1 The village Headman acted as Judge/Magistrate for the community. Decisions\n",
      "by such tribunals were usually through conciliation. The decisions of village/town courts/tribunals\n",
      "were appealable in the higher courts and final appeal lay before the King's Court. Besides\n",
      "adjudication, the system of arbitration was also in vogue.\n",
      "As regards the procedure followed in the courts/tribunals, no formal rules existed, as the law\n",
      "applicable was not statutory but customary or moral. The determination of truth and punishment of\n",
      "the wrong-doer was regarded as a religious duty. Civil proceedings commenced with the filing of a\n",
      "claim which was replied to by the opposite party. Both parties were allowed to produce witnesses so\n",
      "as to prove their respective claims. On the conclusion of the trial, decision was pronounced which\n",
      "was duly enforced. It appears thus, that the system of administration of justice, as it operated in\n",
      "ancient India, was not substantially different from what it is in the modern times. In a sense, the\n",
      "current system seems to be a continuation of the former practices and procedures.\n",
      "2.2\n",
      "Muslim Period\n",
      "The Muslim period in the Indian sub-continent roughly begins in the 11th century A.D. This period\n",
      "may be divided into two parts i.e. the period of early Muslim rulers who ruled Delhi and some other\n",
      "parts of India and the Mughal period, which replaced such Muslim and other rulers in 1526 A.D. The\n",
      "Mughal Dynasty lasted until the middle of 19th century.\n",
      "During the period of Muslim rulers, the Islamic law remained the law of the land in settling civil and\n",
      "criminal disputes. However, common customs and traditions were also invoked in settling secular\n",
      "matters. These rulers were not particularly keen on applying the Islamic law to each and every sphere\n",
      "of life, and let the indigenous customs and institutions continue side by side with Islamic law and\n",
      "institutions. During this period, different courts were established and functioned at the central,\n",
      "provincial, district and tehsil (Pargana) level. These courts had defined jurisdiction in civil, criminal\n",
      "and revenue matters and operated under the authority of the King. On the top of judicial hierarchy\n",
      "was the King's Court, presided over by the King himself, exercising original as well as appellate\n",
      "jurisdiction. The King was the head of judicial administration and he made all appointments to\n",
      "judicial posts. Persons of recognised scholarship, known competence and high integrity were\n",
      "appointed to such posts. The judges held office during the pleasure of the King.\n",
      "The Mughals improved upon the previous experience and created an organised system of\n",
      "administration of justice, all over the country. Courts were created at each and every unit of the\n",
      "administrative division. At the village level, the Hindu system of Panchayats (Council of Elders) was\n",
      "retained, which decided petty disputes of civil and criminal nature, using conciliation and mediation\n",
      "as means of settling disputes. At the town level, there existed courts, presided over by\n",

      "Qazi-e-Parganah. Similarly, at the district (Sarkar) and provincial (Subah) level, courts of Qazis were\n",
      "established. The highest court at the provincial level was that of Adalat Nazim-e-Subah. Similarly, for\n",
      "revenue cases, officers known as Ameen were appointed at the town level. At the district level,\n",
      "revenue cases were dealt with by Amalguzar and at the provincial level by Diwan.\n",
      "The supreme revenue court was called, the Imperial Diwan. Side by side, with civil and revenue\n",
      "courts, criminal courts, presided over by Faujdar, Kotwal, Shiqdar and Subedar functioned.2 The\n",
      "highest court of the land was the Emperor's Court, exercising original and appellate jurisdiction.\n",
      "Although these courts generally exercised exclusive jurisdiction in different categories of cases,\n",
      "however, sometimes their jurisdiction was inter-mixed, in as much as, officers dealing with criminal\n",
      "cases were also required to act as revenue courts. Furthermore, whereas territorially, these courts\n",
      "formed a concentric organization, their jurisdiction was not always exclusive on the basis of\n",
      "territorial limits. Thus, a plaintiff may choose to file his suit in a town or a district or a province. The\n",
      "pecuniary jurisdiction of the courts was also not defined; hence, a case of higher value may be filed in\n",
      "a court of small town. Similarly, appellate jurisdiction existed but was not well defined. Thus, a\n",
      "plaintiff or a complainant, not satisfied with a decision, may file a second suit/complaint in another\n",
      "court. Such later court would decide the matter afresh, without indeed taking into consideration\n",
      "the earlier finding of the court.\n",
      "The emperor made the judicial appointments and persons of high scholarship and good reputation\n",
      "were appointed to the posts. Instructions were given to the judges to be neutral and impartial; and\n",
      "complaints against them were taken seriously. Corrupt officials were removed. Consequently, the\n",
      "scales of justice were very high.3\n",
      "The procedure followed in civil cases was not much different from the procedure, which is applicable\n",
      "today. On a suit being filed, the court summoned the opposite party to admit or deny the claim.\n",
      "Issues were framed in the presence of both the parties who were then required to produce evidence\n",
      "in support of their respective claims. Simple cases were decided, based on such evidence, however,\n",
      "in complicated cases, the judge may launch his own investigation into the matter.4 Maximum effort\n",
      "was made to find the truth. On the conclusion of the proceedings, judgment was pronounced and\n",
      "duly executed. Litigants were allowed to present their cases either personally or through agents.\n",
      "Such agents were not exactly lawyers (in the modern sense of the term) but were fully conversant\n",
      "with the judicial procedure. An officer of the court called Mufti, attached to the court, made the\n",

      "British Period\n",
      "The East India Company was authorized by the Charter of 1623 to decide the cases of its English\n",
      "employees. The Company therefore established its own courts. The President and Council of the\n",
      "Company decided all cases of civil or criminal nature. The subsequent charters further expanded\n",
      "such powers. Thus, the Charter of 1661 authorized the Governor and Council to decide not only the\n",
      "cases of the Company employees but also of persons residing in the settlements. In deciding such\n",
      "cases, the Governor and the Council applied the English laws. As the character of the Company\n",
      "changed from one of a trading concern into a territorial power, newer and additional courts were\n",
      "established for deciding cases and settling disputes of its employees and subjects. The\n",
      "administration of justice was initially confined to the Presidency Town of Bombay, Calcutta and\n",
      "Madras. In view of the huge distances between these Towns and the peculiar conditions prevailing\n",
      "there, the administration of justice, which developed in these Towns, was not uniform. There were\n",
      "established two sets of courts, one for the Presidency Towns and the other for the Mufussil. The\n",
      "principal courts for the town were known as the Supreme Courts and Recorders Courts. These courts\n",
      "consisted of English judges and applied English laws. The English people, residing in such towns\n",
      "alone, were subject to their jurisdiction. The native inhabitants, who were mostly living in the\n",
      "Mufussil, were governed under separate courts called Sadar Dewani Adalat and Sadar Nizamat\n",
      "Adalat, dealing with civil and criminal cases respectively. Such courts applied the local laws and\n",
      "regulations.\n",
      "The Supreme Court of Calcutta was established under the Regulating Act 1773. The Court consisted\n",
      "of a Chief Justice and other judges, exercising both civil and criminal jurisdiction. The Court could\n",
      "also issue certain prerogative writs. In 1798, the Recorders Courts were established at Madras and\n",
      "Bombay, with powers identical to the Supreme Court of Calcutta. Afterwards, the Recorders Court at\n",
      "Madras was substituted by the Supreme Court (under the Parliament Act 1800). A few years later, the\n",
      "Recorders Court at Bombay was also replaced by the Supreme Court (under the Parliament Act\n",
      "1823). These new courts had indeed the same composition, jurisdiction and powers as exercised by\n",
      "the Supreme Court of Calcutta.\n",
      "The High Court of Judicature Act 1861 abolished the Supreme Courts as well as the Sadar Adalats,\n",
      "and in their place, constituted the High Court of Judicature for each Presidency Town. This Court\n",
      "consisted of a Chief Justice and such other number of judges, not exceeding 15. The Act prescribed\n",
      "professional qualifications for such judges together with the mode of their appointment. Thus, it\n",
      "was provided that 1/3rd of the judges should be appointed from amongst the barristers with 5 years\n",
      "standing and 1/3rd from amongst the civil servants, having 3 years experience as a District Judge.\n",
      "The remaining 1/3rd seats were filled from amongst pleaders and members of Subordinate\n",
      "Judiciary, having 5 years experience. The judges were appointed by the Crown and held office\n",
      "during his pleasure. The High Courts exercised original as well as appellate jurisdiction in civil and\n",
      "criminal matters and were also required to supervise the functioning of the Subordinate Courts in\n",
      "their respective domain. Besides the Presidency Towns, High Courts were also established in\n",

      "Introduction\n",
      "\n",
      "The roots of the current judicial system of Pakistan stretch back to the medieval period and even\n",
      "before. The judicial system that we practice today has evolved over a long period of time, spanning\n",
      "roughly over a whole millennium. The system has passed through several epochs, covering the\n",
      "Hindu era, Muslim period including the Mughal Empire, British colonial period and postindependence chapter. Notwithstanding the successive changes i.e. one rule/dynasty substituted\n",
      "by the other, which naturally resulted in the socio-economic and political transformation of the\n",
      "Indian society, the judicial system generally maintained a steady growth and gradual advance\n",
      "towards consolidation and improvement/refinement, without indeed, having to undergo any major\n",
      "disruption or breakdown.\n",
      "All in all, the system experienced and passed through 3 distinct stages of historical development,\n",
      "namely, Hindu Kingdom, Muslim Rule and British Colonial Administration. The 4th and current era,\n",
      "commenced with the partition of India and the establishment of Pakistan, as a sovereign and\n",
      "independent State. The system, thus, has evolved through a process of reform and development.\n",
      "This conclusion enjoys near unanimity among historians and commentators of Indian legal history.\n",
      "During this process of evolution and growth, the judicial system did receive influences and\n",
      "inspirations from foreign doctrines/notions and indigenous norms/practices, both in terms of\n",
      "organizing courts' structure, hierarchy, jurisdiction and adopting trial procedures/practices.\n",
      "Therefore, the present judicial system is not an entirely foreign transplant, as is commonly alleged,\n",
      "but has acquired an indigenous flavour and national colour. And whereas the system may not fully\n",
      "suit the genius of our people or meet the local conditions, its continued application and practice has\n",
      "made it intelligible to the common man. The very fact that increasing number of people are\n",
      "resorting to the courts for the resolution of their conflicts/disputes, indicates that the system enjoys\n",
      "a degree of legitimacy and acceptance.\n",

      "2.1\n",
      "Hindu Period\n",
      "The Hindu period lasts for 3 millennia i.e. from 1500 BC until 1500 AD. Information on the judicial\n",
      "system during Hindu period has been somewhat sketchy, gathered mostly from scattered sources,\n",
      "such as ancient books like Dharamshastra, Smiritis and Arthashastra, and commentaries of the same\n",
      "by historians and jurists. These sources construct a well-defined system of administration of justice\n",
      "during the Hindu period. The King was regarded as the fountain of justice who also discharged\n",
      "judicial functions. In this task, judges as well as his ministers and counselors assisted him. He was the\n",
      "final judicial authority and court of ultimate appeal. At the Capital, besides the King's Court, the\n",
      "Court of Chief Justice existed. This Court, in hierarchy, was next to the King's Court and appeal\n",
      "against its decisions lay to the King's Court. The judges were appointed on the basis of their\n",
      "qualifications and scholarship but the choice was mostly restricted to upper caste i.e. Brahmins.\n",
      "\n",
      "1\n",
      "\n",
      "\fThe Judicial System of Pakistan\n",
      "\n",
      "At the village level, tribunals dispensed justice, which consisted of the assembly of the village, or the\n",
      "caste or the family.1 The village Headman acted as Judge/Magistrate for the community. Decisions\n",
      "by such tribunals were usually through conciliation. The decisions of village/town courts/tribunals\n",
      "were appealable in the higher courts and final appeal lay before the King's Court. Besides\n",
      "adjudication, the system of arbitration was also in vogue.\n",
      "As regards the procedure followed in the courts/tribunals, no formal rules existed, as the law\n",
      "applicable was not statutory but customary or moral. The determination of truth and punishment of\n",
      "the wrong-doer was regarded as a religious duty. Civil proceedings commenced with the filing of a\n",
      "claim which was replied to by the opposite party. Both parties were allowed to produce witnesses so\n",
      "as to prove their respective claims. On the conclusion of the trial, decision was pronounced which\n",
      "was duly enforced. It appears thus, that the system of administration of justice, as it operated in\n",
      "ancient India, was not substantially different from what it is in the modern times. In a sense, the\n",
      "current system seems to be a continuation of the former practices and procedures.\n",
      "2.2\n",
      "Muslim Period\n",
      "The Muslim period in the Indian sub-continent roughly begins in the 11th century A.D. This period\n",
      "may be divided into two parts i.e. the period of early Muslim rulers who ruled Delhi and some other\n",
      "parts of India and the Mughal period, which replaced such Muslim and other rulers in 1526 A.D. The\n",
      "Mughal Dynasty lasted until the middle of 19th century.\n",
      "During the period of Muslim rulers, the Islamic law remained the law of the land in settling civil and\n",
      "criminal disputes. However, common customs and traditions were also invoked in settling secular\n",
      "matters. These rulers were not particularly keen on applying the Islamic law to each and every sphere\n",
      "of life, and let the indigenous customs and institutions continue side by side with Islamic law and\n",
      "institutions. During this period, different courts were established and functioned at the central,\n",
      "provincial, district and tehsil (Pargana) level. These courts had defined jurisdiction in civil, criminal\n",
      "and revenue matters and operated under the authority of the King. On the top of judicial hierarchy\n",
      "was the King's Court, presided over by the King himself, exercising original as well as appellate\n",
      "jurisdiction. The King was the head of judicial administration and he made all appointments to\n",
      "judicial posts. Persons of recognised scholarship, known competence and high integrity were\n",
      "appointed to such posts. The judges held office during the pleasure of the King.\n",
      "The Mughals improved upon the previous experience and created an organised system of\n",
      "administration of justice, all over the country. Courts were created at each and every unit of the\n",
      "administrative division. At the village level, the Hindu system of Panchayats (Council of Elders) was\n",
      "retained, which decided petty disputes of civil and criminal nature, using conciliation and mediation\n",
      "as means of settling disputes. At the town level, there existed courts, presided over by\n",

      "Qazi-e-Parganah. Similarly, at the district (Sarkar) and provincial (Subah) level, courts of Qazis were\n",
      "established. The highest court at the provincial level was that of Adalat Nazim-e-Subah. Similarly, for\n",
      "revenue cases, officers known as Ameen were appointed at the town level. At the district level,\n",
      "revenue cases were dealt with by Amalguzar and at the provincial level by Diwan.\n",
      "The supreme revenue court was called, the Imperial Diwan. Side by side, with civil and revenue\n",
      "courts, criminal courts, presided over by Faujdar, Kotwal, Shiqdar and Subedar functioned.2 The\n",
      "highest court of the land was the Emperor's Court, exercising original and appellate jurisdiction.\n",
      "Although these courts generally exercised exclusive jurisdiction in different categories of cases,\n",
      "however, sometimes their jurisdiction was inter-mixed, in as much as, officers dealing with criminal\n",
      "cases were also required to act as revenue courts. Furthermore, whereas territorially, these courts\n",
      "formed a concentric organization, their jurisdiction was not always exclusive on the basis of\n",
      "territorial limits. Thus, a plaintiff may choose to file his suit in a town or a district or a province. The\n",
      "pecuniary jurisdiction of the courts was also not defined; hence, a case of higher value may be filed in\n",
      "a court of small town. Similarly, appellate jurisdiction existed but was not well defined. Thus, a\n",
      "plaintiff or a complainant, not satisfied with a decision, may file a second suit/complaint in another\n",
      "court. Such later court would decide the matter afresh, without indeed taking into consideration\n",
      "the earlier finding of the court.\n",
      "The emperor made the judicial appointments and persons of high scholarship and good reputation\n",
      "were appointed to the posts. Instructions were given to the judges to be neutral and impartial; and\n",
      "complaints against them were taken seriously. Corrupt officials were removed. Consequently, the\n",
      "scales of justice were very high.3\n",
      "The procedure followed in civil cases was not much different from the procedure, which is applicable\n",
      "today. On a suit being filed, the court summoned the opposite party to admit or deny the claim.\n",
      "Issues were framed in the presence of both the parties who were then required to produce evidence\n",
      "in support of their respective claims. Simple cases were decided, based on such evidence, however,\n",
      "in complicated cases, the judge may launch his own investigation into the matter.4 Maximum effort\n",
      "was made to find the truth. On the conclusion of the proceedings, judgment was pronounced and\n",
      "duly executed. Litigants were allowed to present their cases either personally or through agents.\n",

      "\n",
      "The roots of the current judicial system of Pakistan stretch back to the medieval period and even\n",
      "before. The judicial system that we practice today has evolved over a long period of time, spanning\n",
      "roughly over a whole millennium. The system has passed through several epochs, covering the\n",
      "Hindu era, Muslim period including the Mughal Empire, British colonial period and postindependence chapter. Notwithstanding the successive changes i.e. one rule/dynasty substituted\n",
      "by the other, which naturally resulted in the socio-economic and political transformation of the\n",
      "Indian society, the judicial system generally maintained a steady growth and gradual advance\n",
      "towards consolidation and improvement/refinement, without indeed, having to undergo any major\n",
      "disruption or breakdown.\n",
      "All in all, the system experienced and passed through 3 distinct stages of historical development,\n",
      "namely, Hindu Kingdom, Muslim Rule and British Colonial Administration. The 4th and current era,\n",
      "commenced with the partition of India and the establishment of Pakistan, as a sovereign and\n",
      "independent State. The system, thus, has evolved through a process of reform and development.\n",
      "This conclusion enjoys near unanimity among historians and commentators of Indian legal history.\n",
      "During this process of evolution and growth, the judicial system did receive influences and\n",
      "inspirations from foreign doctrines/notions and indigenous norms/practices, both in terms of\n",
      "organizing courts' structure, hierarchy, jurisdiction and adopting trial procedures/practices.\n",
      "Therefore, the present judicial system is not an entirely foreign transplant, as is commonly alleged,\n",
      "but has acquired an indigenous flavour and national colour. And whereas the system may not fully\n",
      "suit the genius of our people or meet the local conditions, its continued application and practice has\n",
      "made it intelligible to the common man. The very fact that increasing number of people are\n",
      "resorting to the courts for the resolution of their conflicts/disputes, indicates that the system enjoys\n",
      "a degree of legitimacy and acceptance.\n",

      "The Hindu period lasts for 3 millennia i.e. from 1500 BC until 1500 AD. Information on the judicial\n",
      "system during Hindu period has been somewhat sketchy, gathered mostly from scattered sources,\n",
      "such as ancient books like Dharamshastra, Smiritis and Arthashastra, and commentaries of the same\n",
      "by historians and jurists. These sources construct a well-defined system of administration of justice\n",
      "during the Hindu period. The King was regarded as the fountain of justice who also discharged\n",
      "judicial functions. In this task, judges as well as his ministers and counselors assisted him. He was the\n",
      "final judicial authority and court of ultimate appeal. At the Capital, besides the King's Court, the\n",
      "Court of Chief Justice existed. This Court, in hierarchy, was next to the King's Court and appeal\n",
      "against its decisions lay to the King's Court. The judges were appointed on the basis of their\n",
      "qualifications and scholarship but the choice was mostly restricted to upper caste i.e. Brahmins.\n",

      "was the King's Court, presided over by the King himself, exercising original as well as appellate\n",

      "Introduction\n",
      "\n",
      "The roots of the current judicial system of Pakistan stretch back to the medieval period and even\n",
      "before. The judicial system that we practice today has evolved over a long period of time, spanning\n",
      "roughly over a whole millennium. The system has passed through several epochs, covering the\n",
      "Hindu era, Muslim period including the Mughal Empire, British colonial period and postindependence chapter. Notwithstanding the successive changes i.e. one rule/dynasty substituted\n",
      "by the other, which naturally resulted in the socio-economic and political transformation of the\n",
      "Indian society, the judicial system generally maintained a steady growth and gradual advance\n",
      "towards consolidation and improvement/refinement, without indeed, having to undergo any major\n",
      "disruption or breakdown.\n",
      "All in all, the system experienced and passed through 3 distinct stages of historical development,\n",
      "namely, Hindu Kingdom, Muslim Rule and British Colonial Administration. The 4th and current era,\n",
      "commenced with the partition of India and the establishment of Pakistan, as a sovereign and\n",
      "independent State. The system, thus, has evolved through a process of reform and development.\n",
      "This conclusion enjoys near unanimity among historians and commentators of Indian legal history.\n",
      "During this process of evolution and growth, the judicial system did receive influences and\n",
      "inspirations from foreign doctrines/notions and indigenous norms/practices, both in terms of\n",
      "organizing courts' structure, hierarchy, jurisdiction and adopting trial procedures/practices.\n",
      "Therefore, the present judicial system is not an entirely foreign transplant, as is commonly alleged,\n",
      "but has acquired an indigenous flavour and national colour. And whereas the system may not fully\n",
      "suit the genius of our people or meet the local conditions, its continued application and practice has\n",
      "made it intelligible to the common man. The very fact that increasing number of people are\n",
      "resorting to the courts for the resolution of their conflicts/disputes, indicates that the system enjoys\n",
      "a degree of legitimacy and acceptance.\n",

      "2.1\n",
      "Hindu Period\n",
      "The Hindu period lasts for 3 millennia i.e. from 1500 BC until 1500 AD. Information on the judicial\n",
      "system during Hindu period has been somewhat sketchy, gathered mostly from scattered sources,\n",
      "such as ancient books like Dharamshastra, Smiritis and Arthashastra, and commentaries of the same\n",
      "by historians and jurists. These sources construct a well-defined system of administration of justice\n",
      "during the Hindu period. The King was regarded as the fountain of justice who also discharged\n",
      "judicial functions. In this task, judges as well as his ministers and counselors assisted him. He was the\n",
      "final judicial authority and court of ultimate appeal. At the Capital, besides the King's Court, the\n",
      "Court of Chief Justice existed. This Court, in hierarchy, was next to the King's Court and appeal\n",
      "against its decisions lay to the King's Court. The judges were appointed on the basis of their\n",
      "qualifications and scholarship but the choice was mostly restricted to upper caste i.e. Brahmins.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\fThe Judicial System of Pakistan\n",
      "\n",
      "At the village level, tribunals dispensed justice, which consisted of the assembly of the village, or the\n",
      "caste or the family.1 The village Headman acted as Judge/Magistrate for the community. Decisions\n",
      "by such tribunals were usually through conciliation. The decisions of village/town courts/tribunals\n",
      "were appealable in the higher courts and final appeal lay before the King's Court. Besides\n",
      "adjudication, the system of arbitration was also in vogue.\n",
      "As regards the procedure followed in the courts/tribunals, no formal rules existed, as the law\n",
      "applicable was not statutory but customary or moral. The determination of truth and punishment of\n",
      "the wrong-doer was regarded as a religious duty. Civil proceedings commenced with the filing of a\n",
      "claim which was replied to by the opposite party. Both parties were allowed to produce witnesses so\n",
      "as to prove their respective claims. On the conclusion of the trial, decision was pronounced which\n",
      "was duly enforced. It appears thus, that the system of administration of justice, as it operated in\n",
      "ancient India, was not substantially different from what it is in the modern times. In a sense, the\n",
      "current system seems to be a continuation of the former practices and procedures.\n",
      "2.2\n",
      "Muslim Period\n",
      "The Muslim period in the Indian sub-continent roughly begins in the 11th century A.D. This period\n",
      "may be divided into two parts i.e. the period of early Muslim rulers who ruled Delhi and some other\n",
      "parts of India and the Mughal period, which replaced such Muslim and other rulers in 1526 A.D. The\n",
      "Mughal Dynasty lasted until the middle of 19th century.\n",
      "During the period of Muslim rulers, the Islamic law remained the law of the land in settling civil and\n",
      "criminal disputes. However, common customs and traditions were also invoked in settling secular\n",
      "matters. These rulers were not particularly keen on applying the Islamic law to each and every sphere\n",
      "of life, and let the indigenous customs and institutions continue side by side with Islamic law and\n",
      "institutions. During this period, different courts were established and functioned at the central,\n",
      "provincial, district and tehsil (Pargana) level. These courts had defined jurisdiction in civil, criminal\n",
      "and revenue matters and operated under the authority of the King. On the top of judicial hierarchy\n",
      "was the King's Court, presided over by the King himself, exercising original as well as appellate\n",
      "jurisdiction. The King was the head of judicial administration and he made all appointments to\n",
      "judicial posts. Persons of recognised scholarship, known competence and high integrity were\n",
      "appointed to such posts. The judges held office during the pleasure of the King.\n",
      "The Mughals improved upon the previous experience and created an organised system of\n",
      "administration of justice, all over the country. Courts were created at each and every unit of the\n",
      "administrative division. At the village level, the Hindu system of Panchayats (Council of Elders) was\n",
      "retained, which decided petty disputes of civil and criminal nature, using conciliation and mediation\n",
      "as means of settling disputes. At the town level, there existed courts, presided over by\n",

      "established. The highest court at the provincial level was that of Adalat Nazim-e-Subah. Similarly, for\n",
      "revenue cases, officers known as Ameen were appointed at the town level. At the district level,\n",
      "revenue cases were dealt with by Amalguzar and at the provincial level by Diwan.\n",
      "The supreme revenue court was called, the Imperial Diwan. Side by side, with civil and revenue\n",

      "highest court of the land was the Emperor's Court, exercising original and appellate jurisdiction.\n",
      "Although these courts generally exercised exclusive jurisdiction in different categories of cases,\n",
      "however, sometimes their jurisdiction was inter-mixed, in as much as, officers dealing with criminal\n",
      "cases were also required to act as revenue courts. Furthermore, whereas territorially, these courts\n",
      "formed a concentric organization, their jurisdiction was not always exclusive on the basis of\n",
      "territorial limits. Thus, a plaintiff may choose to file his suit in a town or a district or a province. The\n",
      "pecuniary jurisdiction of the courts was also not defined; hence, a case of higher value may be filed in\n",
      "a court of small town. Similarly, appellate jurisdiction existed but was not well defined. Thus, a\n",
      "plaintiff or a complainant, not satisfied with a decision, may file a second suit/complaint in another\n",

      "The emperor made the judicial appointments and persons of high scholarship and good reputation\n",
      "were appointed to the posts. Instructions were given to the judges to be neutral and impartial; and\n",
      "complaints against them were taken seriously. Corrupt officials were removed. Consequently, the\n",
      "scales of justice were very high.3\n",
      "The procedure followed in civil cases was not much different from the procedure, which is applicable\n",
      "today. On a suit being filed, the court summoned the opposite party to admit or deny the claim.\n",
      "Issues were framed in the presence of both the parties who were then required to produce evidence\n",
      "in support of their respective claims. Simple cases were decided, based on such evidence, however,\n",
      "in complicated cases, the judge may launch his own investigation into the matter.4 Maximum effort\n",
      "was made to find the truth. On the conclusion of the proceedings, judgment was pronounced and\n",
      "duly executed. Litigants were allowed to present their cases either personally or through agents.\n",
      "Such agents were not exactly lawyers (in the modern sense of the term) but were fully conversant\n",

      "Introduction\n",
      "\n",
      "The roots of the current judicial system of Pakistan stretch back to the medieval period and even\n",
      "before. The judicial system that we practice today has evolved over a long period of time, spanning\n",
      "roughly over a whole millennium. The system has passed through several epochs, covering the\n",
      "Hindu era, Muslim period including the Mughal Empire, British colonial period and postindependence chapter. Notwithstanding the successive changes i.e. one rule/dynasty substituted\n",
      "by the other, which naturally resulted in the socio-economic and political transformation of the\n",
      "Indian society, the judicial system generally maintained a steady growth and gradual advance\n",
      "towards consolidation and improvement/refinement, without indeed, having to undergo any major\n",
      "disruption or breakdown.\n",
      "All in all, the system experienced and passed through 3 distinct stages of historical development,\n",
      "namely, Hindu Kingdom, Muslim Rule and British Colonial Administration. The 4th and current era,\n",
      "commenced with the partition of India and the establishment of Pakistan, as a sovereign and\n",
      "independent State. The system, thus, has evolved through a process of reform and development.\n",
      "This conclusion enjoys near unanimity among historians and commentators of Indian legal history.\n",
      "During this process of evolution and growth, the judicial system did receive influences and\n",
      "inspirations from foreign doctrines/notions and indigenous norms/practices, both in terms of\n",
      "organizing courts' structure, hierarchy, jurisdiction and adopting trial procedures/practices.\n",
      "Therefore, the present judicial system is not an entirely foreign transplant, as is commonly alleged,\n",
      "but has acquired an indigenous flavour and national colour. And whereas the system may not fully\n",
      "suit the genius of our people or meet the local conditions, its continued application and practice has\n",
      "made it intelligible to the common man. The very fact that increasing number of people are\n",
      "resorting to the courts for the resolution of their conflicts/disputes, indicates that the system enjoys\n",
      "a degree of legitimacy and acceptance.\n",

      "Historical Retrospect\n",

      "2.1\n",
      "Hindu Period\n",
      "The Hindu period lasts for 3 millennia i.e. from 1500 BC until 1500 AD. Information on the judicial\n",
      "system during Hindu period has been somewhat sketchy, gathered mostly from scattered sources,\n",
      "such as ancient books like Dharamshastra, Smiritis and Arthashastra, and commentaries of the same\n",
      "by historians and jurists. These sources construct a well-defined system of administration of justice\n",
      "during the Hindu period. The King was regarded as the fountain of justice who also discharged\n",
      "judicial functions. In this task, judges as well as his ministers and counselors assisted him. He was the\n",
      "final judicial authority and court of ultimate appeal. At the Capital, besides the King's Court, the\n",
      "Court of Chief Justice existed. This Court, in hierarchy, was next to the King's Court and appeal\n",
      "against its decisions lay to the King's Court. The judges were appointed on the basis of their\n",
      "qualifications and scholarship but the choice was mostly restricted to upper caste i.e. Brahmins.\n",
      "\n",
      "1\n",
      "\n",
      "\fThe Judicial System of Pakistan\n",
      "\n",
      "At the village level, tribunals dispensed justice, which consisted of the assembly of the village, or the\n",
      "caste or the family.1 The village Headman acted as Judge/Magistrate for the community. Decisions\n",
      "by such tribunals were usually through conciliation. The decisions of village/town courts/tribunals\n",
      "were appealable in the higher courts and final appeal lay before the King's Court. Besides\n",
      "adjudication, the system of arbitration was also in vogue.\n",
      "As regards the procedure followed in the courts/tribunals, no formal rules existed, as the law\n",
      "applicable was not statutory but customary or moral. The determination of truth and punishment of\n",
      "the wrong-doer was regarded as a religious duty. Civil proceedings commenced with the filing of a\n",
      "claim which was replied to by the opposite party. Both parties were allowed to produce witnesses so\n",
      "as to prove their respective claims. On the conclusion of the trial, decision was pronounced which\n",
      "was duly enforced. It appears thus, that the system of administration of justice, as it operated in\n",
      "ancient India, was not substantially different from what it is in the modern times. In a sense, the\n",
      "current system seems to be a continuation of the former practices and procedures.\n",
      "2.2\n",
      "Muslim Period\n",
      "The Muslim period in the Indian sub-continent roughly begins in the 11th century A.D. This period\n",
      "may be divided into two parts i.e. the period of early Muslim rulers who ruled Delhi and some other\n",
      "parts of India and the Mughal period, which replaced such Muslim and other rulers in 1526 A.D. The\n",
      "Mughal Dynasty lasted until the middle of 19th century.\n",
      "During the period of Muslim rulers, the Islamic law remained the law of the land in settling civil and\n",
      "criminal disputes. However, common customs and traditions were also invoked in settling secular\n",
      "matters. These rulers were not particularly keen on applying the Islamic law to each and every sphere\n",
      "of life, and let the indigenous customs and institutions continue side by side with Islamic law and\n",
      "institutions. During this period, different courts were established and functioned at the central,\n",
      "provincial, district and tehsil (Pargana) level. These courts had defined jurisdiction in civil, criminal\n",
      "and revenue matters and operated under the authority of the King. On the top of judicial hierarchy\n",
      "was the King's Court, presided over by the King himself, exercising original as well as appellate\n",
      "jurisdiction. The King was the head of judicial administration and he made all appointments to\n",
      "judicial posts. Persons of recognised scholarship, known competence and high integrity were\n",
      "appointed to such posts. The judges held office during the pleasure of the King.\n",
      "The Mughals improved upon the previous experience and created an organised system of\n",
      "administration of justice, all over the country. Courts were created at each and every unit of the\n",
      "administrative division. At the village level, the Hindu system of Panchayats (Council of Elders) was\n",
      "retained, which decided petty disputes of civil and criminal nature, using conciliation and mediation\n",
      "as means of settling disputes. At the town level, there existed courts, presided over by\n",

      "Qazi-e-Parganah. Similarly, at the district (Sarkar) and provincial (Subah) level, courts of Qazis were\n",
      "established. The highest court at the provincial level was that of Adalat Nazim-e-Subah. Similarly, for\n",
      "revenue cases, officers known as Ameen were appointed at the town level. At the district level,\n",
      "revenue cases were dealt with by Amalguzar and at the provincial level by Diwan.\n",
      "The supreme revenue court was called, the Imperial Diwan. Side by side, with civil and revenue\n",
      "courts, criminal courts, presided over by Faujdar, Kotwal, Shiqdar and Subedar functioned.2 The\n",
      "highest court of the land was the Emperor's Court, exercising original and appellate jurisdiction.\n",
      "Although these courts generally exercised exclusive jurisdiction in different categories of cases,\n",
      "however, sometimes their jurisdiction was inter-mixed, in as much as, officers dealing with criminal\n",
      "cases were also required to act as revenue courts. Furthermore, whereas territorially, these courts\n",
      "formed a concentric organization, their jurisdiction was not always exclusive on the basis of\n",
      "territorial limits. Thus, a plaintiff may choose to file his suit in a town or a district or a province. The\n",
      "pecuniary jurisdiction of the courts was also not defined; hence, a case of higher value may be filed in\n",
      "a court of small town. Similarly, appellate jurisdiction existed but was not well defined. Thus, a\n",
      "plaintiff or a complainant, not satisfied with a decision, may file a second suit/complaint in another\n",
      "court. Such later court would decide the matter afresh, without indeed taking into consideration\n",
      "the earlier finding of the court.\n",
      "The emperor made the judicial appointments and persons of high scholarship and good reputation\n",
      "were appointed to the posts. Instructions were given to the judges to be neutral and impartial; and\n",
      "complaints against them were taken seriously. Corrupt officials were removed. Consequently, the\n",
      "scales of justice were very high.3\n",
      "The procedure followed in civil cases was not much different from the procedure, which is applicable\n",
      "today. On a suit being filed, the court summoned the opposite party to admit or deny the claim.\n",
      "Issues were framed in the presence of both the parties who were then required to produce evidence\n",
      "in support of their respective claims. Simple cases were decided, based on such evidence, however,\n",
      "in complicated cases, the judge may launch his own investigation into the matter.4 Maximum effort\n",
      "was made to find the truth. On the conclusion of the proceedings, judgment was pronounced and\n",
      "duly executed. Litigants were allowed to present their cases either personally or through agents.\n",
      "Such agents were not exactly lawyers (in the modern sense of the term) but were fully conversant\n",
      "with the judicial procedure. An officer of the court called Mufti, attached to the court, made the\n",

      "The East India Company was authorized by the Charter of 1623 to decide the cases of its English\n",
      "employees. The Company therefore established its own courts. The President and Council of the\n",
      "Company decided all cases of civil or criminal nature. The subsequent charters further expanded\n",
      "such powers. Thus, the Charter of 1661 authorized the Governor and Council to decide not only the\n",
      "cases of the Company employees but also of persons residing in the settlements. In deciding such\n",
      "cases, the Governor and the Council applied the English laws. As the character of the Company\n",
      "changed from one of a trading concern into a territorial power, newer and additional courts were\n",
      "established for deciding cases and settling disputes of its employees and subjects. The\n",
      "administration of justice was initially confined to the Presidency Town of Bombay, Calcutta and\n",
      "Madras. In view of the huge distances between these Towns and the peculiar conditions prevailing\n",
      "there, the administration of justice, which developed in these Towns, was not uniform. There were\n",
      "established two sets of courts, one for the Presidency Towns and the other for the Mufussil. The\n",
      "principal courts for the town were known as the Supreme Courts and Recorders Courts. These courts\n",
      "consisted of English judges and applied English laws. The English people, residing in such towns\n",
      "alone, were subject to their jurisdiction. The native inhabitants, who were mostly living in the\n",
      "Mufussil, were governed under separate courts called Sadar Dewani Adalat and Sadar Nizamat\n",
      "Adalat, dealing with civil and criminal cases respectively. Such courts applied the local laws and\n",
      "regulations.\n",
      "The Supreme Court of Calcutta was established under the Regulating Act 1773. The Court consisted\n",
      "of a Chief Justice and other judges, exercising both civil and criminal jurisdiction. The Court could\n",
      "also issue certain prerogative writs. In 1798, the Recorders Courts were established at Madras and\n",
      "Bombay, with powers identical to the Supreme Court of Calcutta. Afterwards, the Recorders Court at\n",
      "Madras was substituted by the Supreme Court (under the Parliament Act 1800). A few years later, the\n",
      "Recorders Court at Bombay was also replaced by the Supreme Court (under the Parliament Act\n",
      "1823). These new courts had indeed the same composition, jurisdiction and powers as exercised by\n",
      "the Supreme Court of Calcutta.\n",
      "The High Court of Judicature Act 1861 abolished the Supreme Courts as well as the Sadar Adalats,\n",
      "and in their place, constituted the High Court of Judicature for each Presidency Town. This Court\n",
      "consisted of a Chief Justice and such other number of judges, not exceeding 15. The Act prescribed\n",
      "professional qualifications for such judges together with the mode of their appointment. Thus, it\n",
      "was provided that 1/3rd of the judges should be appointed from amongst the barristers with 5 years\n",

      "during his pleasure. The High Courts exercised original as well as appellate jurisdiction in civil and\n",
      "criminal matters and were also required to supervise the functioning of the Subordinate Courts in\n",
      "their respective domain. Besides the Presidency Towns, High Courts were also established in\n",

      "Introduction\n",
      "\n",
      "The roots of the current judicial system of Pakistan stretch back to the medieval period and even\n",
      "before. The judicial system that we practice today has evolved over a long period of time, spanning\n",
      "roughly over a whole millennium. The system has passed through several epochs, covering the\n",
      "Hindu era, Muslim period including the Mughal Empire, British colonial period and postindependence chapter. Notwithstanding the successive changes i.e. one rule/dynasty substituted\n",
      "by the other, which naturally resulted in the socio-economic and political transformation of the\n",
      "Indian society, the judicial system generally maintained a steady growth and gradual advance\n",
      "towards consolidation and improvement/refinement, without indeed, having to undergo any major\n",
      "disruption or breakdown.\n",
      "All in all, the system experienced and passed through 3 distinct stages of historical development,\n",
      "namely, Hindu Kingdom, Muslim Rule and British Colonial Administration. The 4th and current era,\n",
      "commenced with the partition of India and the establishment of Pakistan, as a sovereign and\n",
      "independent State. The system, thus, has evolved through a process of reform and development.\n",
      "This conclusion enjoys near unanimity among historians and commentators of Indian legal history.\n",
      "During this process of evolution and growth, the judicial system did receive influences and\n",
      "inspirations from foreign doctrines/notions and indigenous norms/practices, both in terms of\n",
      "organizing courts' structure, hierarchy, jurisdiction and adopting trial procedures/practices.\n",
      "Therefore, the present judicial system is not an entirely foreign transplant, as is commonly alleged,\n",
      "but has acquired an indigenous flavour and national colour. And whereas the system may not fully\n",
      "suit the genius of our people or meet the local conditions, its continued application and practice has\n",
      "made it intelligible to the common man. The very fact that increasing number of people are\n",
      "resorting to the courts for the resolution of their conflicts/disputes, indicates that the system enjoys\n",
      "a degree of legitimacy and acceptance.\n",

      "Historical Retrospect\n",

      "2.1\n",
      "Hindu Period\n",
      "The Hindu period lasts for 3 millennia i.e. from 1500 BC until 1500 AD. Information on the judicial\n",
      "system during Hindu period has been somewhat sketchy, gathered mostly from scattered sources,\n",
      "such as ancient books like Dharamshastra, Smiritis and Arthashastra, and commentaries of the same\n",
      "by historians and jurists. These sources construct a well-defined system of administration of justice\n",
      "during the Hindu period. The King was regarded as the fountain of justice who also discharged\n",
      "judicial functions. In this task, judges as well as his ministers and counselors assisted him. He was the\n",
      "final judicial authority and court of ultimate appeal. At the Capital, besides the King's Court, the\n",
      "Court of Chief Justice existed. This Court, in hierarchy, was next to the King's Court and appeal\n",
      "against its decisions lay to the King's Court. The judges were appointed on the basis of their\n",
      "qualifications and scholarship but the choice was mostly restricted to upper caste i.e. Brahmins.\n",
      "\n",
      "1\n",
      "\n",
      "\fThe Judicial System of Pakistan\n",
      "\n",
      "At the village level, tribunals dispensed justice, which consisted of the assembly of the village, or the\n",
      "caste or the family.1 The village Headman acted as Judge/Magistrate for the community. Decisions\n",
      "by such tribunals were usually through conciliation. The decisions of village/town courts/tribunals\n",
      "were appealable in the higher courts and final appeal lay before the King's Court. Besides\n",
      "adjudication, the system of arbitration was also in vogue.\n",
      "As regards the procedure followed in the courts/tribunals, no formal rules existed, as the law\n",
      "applicable was not statutory but customary or moral. The determination of truth and punishment of\n",
      "the wrong-doer was regarded as a religious duty. Civil proceedings commenced with the filing of a\n",
      "claim which was replied to by the opposite party. Both parties were allowed to produce witnesses so\n",
      "as to prove their respective claims. On the conclusion of the trial, decision was pronounced which\n",
      "was duly enforced. It appears thus, that the system of administration of justice, as it operated in\n",
      "ancient India, was not substantially different from what it is in the modern times. In a sense, the\n",
      "current system seems to be a continuation of the former practices and procedures.\n",
      "2.2\n",
      "Muslim Period\n",
      "The Muslim period in the Indian sub-continent roughly begins in the 11th century A.D. This period\n",
      "may be divided into two parts i.e. the period of early Muslim rulers who ruled Delhi and some other\n",
      "parts of India and the Mughal period, which replaced such Muslim and other rulers in 1526 A.D. The\n",
      "Mughal Dynasty lasted until the middle of 19th century.\n",
      "During the period of Muslim rulers, the Islamic law remained the law of the land in settling civil and\n",
      "criminal disputes. However, common customs and traditions were also invoked in settling secular\n",
      "matters. These rulers were not particularly keen on applying the Islamic law to each and every sphere\n",
      "of life, and let the indigenous customs and institutions continue side by side with Islamic law and\n",
      "institutions. During this period, different courts were established and functioned at the central,\n",
      "provincial, district and tehsil (Pargana) level. These courts had defined jurisdiction in civil, criminal\n",
      "and revenue matters and operated under the authority of the King. On the top of judicial hierarchy\n",
      "was the King's Court, presided over by the King himself, exercising original as well as appellate\n",
      "jurisdiction. The King was the head of judicial administration and he made all appointments to\n",
      "judicial posts. Persons of recognised scholarship, known competence and high integrity were\n",
      "appointed to such posts. The judges held office during the pleasure of the King.\n",
      "The Mughals improved upon the previous experience and created an organised system of\n",
      "administration of justice, all over the country. Courts were created at each and every unit of the\n",
      "administrative division. At the village level, the Hindu system of Panchayats (Council of Elders) was\n",
      "retained, which decided petty disputes of civil and criminal nature, using conciliation and mediation\n",
      "as means of settling disputes. At the town level, there existed courts, presided over by\n",

      "Qazi-e-Parganah. Similarly, at the district (Sarkar) and provincial (Subah) level, courts of Qazis were\n",
      "established. The highest court at the provincial level was that of Adalat Nazim-e-Subah. Similarly, for\n",
      "revenue cases, officers known as Ameen were appointed at the town level. At the district level,\n",
      "revenue cases were dealt with by Amalguzar and at the provincial level by Diwan.\n",
      "The supreme revenue court was called, the Imperial Diwan. Side by side, with civil and revenue\n",
      "courts, criminal courts, presided over by Faujdar, Kotwal, Shiqdar and Subedar functioned.2 The\n",
      "highest court of the land was the Emperor's Court, exercising original and appellate jurisdiction.\n",
      "Although these courts generally exercised exclusive jurisdiction in different categories of cases,\n",
      "however, sometimes their jurisdiction was inter-mixed, in as much as, officers dealing with criminal\n",
      "cases were also required to act as revenue courts. Furthermore, whereas territorially, these courts\n",
      "formed a concentric organization, their jurisdiction was not always exclusive on the basis of\n",
      "territorial limits. Thus, a plaintiff may choose to file his suit in a town or a district or a province. The\n",
      "pecuniary jurisdiction of the courts was also not defined; hence, a case of higher value may be filed in\n",
      "a court of small town. Similarly, appellate jurisdiction existed but was not well defined. Thus, a\n",
      "plaintiff or a complainant, not satisfied with a decision, may file a second suit/complaint in another\n",
      "court. Such later court would decide the matter afresh, without indeed taking into consideration\n",
      "the earlier finding of the court.\n",
      "The emperor made the judicial appointments and persons of high scholarship and good reputation\n",
      "were appointed to the posts. Instructions were given to the judges to be neutral and impartial; and\n",
      "complaints against them were taken seriously. Corrupt officials were removed. Consequently, the\n",
      "scales of justice were very high.3\n",
      "The procedure followed in civil cases was not much different from the procedure, which is applicable\n",
      "today. On a suit being filed, the court summoned the opposite party to admit or deny the claim.\n",
      "Issues were framed in the presence of both the parties who were then required to produce evidence\n",
      "in support of their respective claims. Simple cases were decided, based on such evidence, however,\n",
      "in complicated cases, the judge may launch his own investigation into the matter.4 Maximum effort\n",
      "was made to find the truth. On the conclusion of the proceedings, judgment was pronounced and\n",
      "duly executed. Litigants were allowed to present their cases either personally or through agents.\n",
      "Such agents were not exactly lawyers (in the modern sense of the term) but were fully conversant\n",
      "with the judicial procedure. An officer of the court called Mufti, attached to the court, made the\n",

      "Introduction\n",
      "\n",
      "The roots of the current judicial system of Pakistan stretch back to the medieval period and even\n",
      "before. The judicial system that we practice today has evolved over a long period of time, spanning\n",
      "roughly over a whole millennium. The system has passed through several epochs, covering the\n",
      "Hindu era, Muslim period including the Mughal Empire, British colonial period and postindependence chapter. Notwithstanding the successive changes i.e. one rule/dynasty substituted\n",
      "by the other, which naturally resulted in the socio-economic and political transformation of the\n",
      "Indian society, the judicial system generally maintained a steady growth and gradual advance\n",
      "towards consolidation and improvement/refinement, without indeed, having to undergo any major\n",
      "disruption or breakdown.\n",
      "All in all, the system experienced and passed through 3 distinct stages of historical development,\n",
      "namely, Hindu Kingdom, Muslim Rule and British Colonial Administration. The 4th and current era,\n",
      "commenced with the partition of India and the establishment of Pakistan, as a sovereign and\n",
      "independent State. The system, thus, has evolved through a process of reform and development.\n",
      "This conclusion enjoys near unanimity among historians and commentators of Indian legal history.\n",
      "During this process of evolution and growth, the judicial system did receive influences and\n",
      "inspirations from foreign doctrines/notions and indigenous norms/practices, both in terms of\n",
      "organizing courts' structure, hierarchy, jurisdiction and adopting trial procedures/practices.\n",
      "Therefore, the present judicial system is not an entirely foreign transplant, as is commonly alleged,\n",
      "but has acquired an indigenous flavour and national colour. And whereas the system may not fully\n",
      "suit the genius of our people or meet the local conditions, its continued application and practice has\n",
      "made it intelligible to the common man. The very fact that increasing number of people are\n",
      "resorting to the courts for the resolution of their conflicts/disputes, indicates that the system enjoys\n",
      "a degree of legitimacy and acceptance.\n",

      "2.1\n",
      "Hindu Period\n",
      "The Hindu period lasts for 3 millennia i.e. from 1500 BC until 1500 AD. Information on the judicial\n",
      "system during Hindu period has been somewhat sketchy, gathered mostly from scattered sources,\n",
      "such as ancient books like Dharamshastra, Smiritis and Arthashastra, and commentaries of the same\n",
      "by historians and jurists. These sources construct a well-defined system of administration of justice\n",
      "during the Hindu period. The King was regarded as the fountain of justice who also discharged\n",
      "judicial functions. In this task, judges as well as his ministers and counselors assisted him. He was the\n",
      "final judicial authority and court of ultimate appeal. At the Capital, besides the King's Court, the\n",
      "Court of Chief Justice existed. This Court, in hierarchy, was next to the King's Court and appeal\n",
      "against its decisions lay to the King's Court. The judges were appointed on the basis of their\n",
      "qualifications and scholarship but the choice was mostly restricted to upper caste i.e. Brahmins.\n",

      "\fThe Judicial System of Pakistan\n",
      "\n",
      "At the village level, tribunals dispensed justice, which consisted of the assembly of the village, or the\n",
      "caste or the family.1 The village Headman acted as Judge/Magistrate for the community. Decisions\n",
      "by such tribunals were usually through conciliation. The decisions of village/town courts/tribunals\n",
      "were appealable in the higher courts and final appeal lay before the King's Court. Besides\n",
      "adjudication, the system of arbitration was also in vogue.\n",
      "As regards the procedure followed in the courts/tribunals, no formal rules existed, as the law\n",
      "applicable was not statutory but customary or moral. The determination of truth and punishment of\n",
      "the wrong-doer was regarded as a religious duty. Civil proceedings commenced with the filing of a\n",
      "claim which was replied to by the opposite party. Both parties were allowed to produce witnesses so\n",
      "as to prove their respective claims. On the conclusion of the trial, decision was pronounced which\n",
      "was duly enforced. It appears thus, that the system of administration of justice, as it operated in\n",
      "ancient India, was not substantially different from what it is in the modern times. In a sense, the\n",
      "current system seems to be a continuation of the former practices and procedures.\n",

      "Introduction\n",
      "\n",
      "The roots of the current judicial system of Pakistan stretch back to the medieval period and even\n",
      "before. The judicial system that we practice today has evolved over a long period of time, spanning\n",
      "roughly over a whole millennium. The system has passed through several epochs, covering the\n",
      "Hindu era, Muslim period including the Mughal Empire, British colonial period and postindependence chapter. Notwithstanding the successive changes i.e. one rule/dynasty substituted\n",
      "by the other, which naturally resulted in the socio-economic and political transformation of the\n",
      "Indian society, the judicial system generally maintained a steady growth and gradual advance\n",
      "towards consolidation and improvement/refinement, without indeed, having to undergo any major\n",
      "disruption or breakdown.\n",
      "All in all, the system experienced and passed through 3 distinct stages of historical development,\n",
      "namely, Hindu Kingdom, Muslim Rule and British Colonial Administration. The 4th and current era,\n",
      "commenced with the partition of India and the establishment of Pakistan, as a sovereign and\n",
      "independent State. The system, thus, has evolved through a process of reform and development.\n",
      "This conclusion enjoys near unanimity among historians and commentators of Indian legal history.\n",
      "During this process of evolution and growth, the judicial system did receive influences and\n",
      "inspirations from foreign doctrines/notions and indigenous norms/practices, both in terms of\n",
      "organizing courts' structure, hierarchy, jurisdiction and adopting trial procedures/practices.\n",
      "Therefore, the present judicial system is not an entirely foreign transplant, as is commonly alleged,\n",
      "but has acquired an indigenous flavour and national colour. And whereas the system may not fully\n",
      "suit the genius of our people or meet the local conditions, its continued application and practice has\n",
      "made it intelligible to the common man. The very fact that increasing number of people are\n",
      "resorting to the courts for the resolution of their conflicts/disputes, indicates that the system enjoys\n",
      "a degree of legitimacy and acceptance.\n",

      "2.1\n",
      "Hindu Period\n",
      "The Hindu period lasts for 3 millennia i.e. from 1500 BC until 1500 AD. Information on the judicial\n",
      "system during Hindu period has been somewhat sketchy, gathered mostly from scattered sources,\n",
      "such as ancient books like Dharamshastra, Smiritis and Arthashastra, and commentaries of the same\n",
      "by historians and jurists. These sources construct a well-defined system of administration of justice\n",
      "during the Hindu period. The King was regarded as the fountain of justice who also discharged\n",
      "judicial functions. In this task, judges as well as his ministers and counselors assisted him. He was the\n",
      "final judicial authority and court of ultimate appeal. At the Capital, besides the King's Court, the\n",
      "Court of Chief Justice existed. This Court, in hierarchy, was next to the King's Court and appeal\n",
      "against its decisions lay to the King's Court. The judges were appointed on the basis of their\n",
      "qualifications and scholarship but the choice was mostly restricted to upper caste i.e. Brahmins.\n",
      "\n",
      "1\n",
      "\n",
      "\fThe Judicial System of Pakistan\n",
      "\n",
      "At the village level, tribunals dispensed justice, which consisted of the assembly of the village, or the\n",
      "caste or the family.1 The village Headman acted as Judge/Magistrate for the community. Decisions\n",
      "by such tribunals were usually through conciliation. The decisions of village/town courts/tribunals\n",
      "were appealable in the higher courts and final appeal lay before the King's Court. Besides\n",
      "adjudication, the system of arbitration was also in vogue.\n",
      "As regards the procedure followed in the courts/tribunals, no formal rules existed, as the law\n",
      "applicable was not statutory but customary or moral. The determination of truth and punishment of\n",
      "the wrong-doer was regarded as a religious duty. Civil proceedings commenced with the filing of a\n",
      "claim which was replied to by the opposite party. Both parties were allowed to produce witnesses so\n",
      "as to prove their respective claims. On the conclusion of the trial, decision was pronounced which\n",
      "was duly enforced. It appears thus, that the system of administration of justice, as it operated in\n",
      "ancient India, was not substantially different from what it is in the modern times. In a sense, the\n",
      "current system seems to be a continuation of the former practices and procedures.\n",
      "2.2\n",
      "Muslim Period\n",
      "The Muslim period in the Indian sub-continent roughly begins in the 11th century A.D. This period\n",
      "may be divided into two parts i.e. the period of early Muslim rulers who ruled Delhi and some other\n",
      "parts of India and the Mughal period, which replaced such Muslim and other rulers in 1526 A.D. The\n",
      "Mughal Dynasty lasted until the middle of 19th century.\n",
      "During the period of Muslim rulers, the Islamic law remained the law of the land in settling civil and\n",
      "criminal disputes. However, common customs and traditions were also invoked in settling secular\n",
      "matters. These rulers were not particularly keen on applying the Islamic law to each and every sphere\n",
      "of life, and let the indigenous customs and institutions continue side by side with Islamic law and\n",
      "institutions. During this period, different courts were established and functioned at the central,\n",
      "provincial, district and tehsil (Pargana) level. These courts had defined jurisdiction in civil, criminal\n",
      "and revenue matters and operated under the authority of the King. On the top of judicial hierarchy\n",
      "was the King's Court, presided over by the King himself, exercising original as well as appellate\n",
      "jurisdiction. The King was the head of judicial administration and he made all appointments to\n",
      "judicial posts. Persons of recognised scholarship, known competence and high integrity were\n",
      "appointed to such posts. The judges held office during the pleasure of the King.\n",
      "The Mughals improved upon the previous experience and created an organised system of\n",
      "administration of justice, all over the country. Courts were created at each and every unit of the\n",
      "administrative division. At the village level, the Hindu system of Panchayats (Council of Elders) was\n",
      "retained, which decided petty disputes of civil and criminal nature, using conciliation and mediation\n",
      "as means of settling disputes. At the town level, there existed courts, presided over by\n",

      "established. The highest court at the provincial level was that of Adalat Nazim-e-Subah. Similarly, for\n",
      "revenue cases, officers known as Ameen were appointed at the town level. At the district level,\n",
      "revenue cases were dealt with by Amalguzar and at the provincial level by Diwan.\n",
      "The supreme revenue court was called, the Imperial Diwan. Side by side, with civil and revenue\n",

      "highest court of the land was the Emperor's Court, exercising original and appellate jurisdiction.\n",
      "Although these courts generally exercised exclusive jurisdiction in different categories of cases,\n",
      "however, sometimes their jurisdiction was inter-mixed, in as much as, officers dealing with criminal\n",
      "cases were also required to act as revenue courts. Furthermore, whereas territorially, these courts\n",
      "formed a concentric organization, their jurisdiction was not always exclusive on the basis of\n",
      "territorial limits. Thus, a plaintiff may choose to file his suit in a town or a district or a province. The\n",
      "pecuniary jurisdiction of the courts was also not defined; hence, a case of higher value may be filed in\n",
      "a court of small town. Similarly, appellate jurisdiction existed but was not well defined. Thus, a\n",
      "plaintiff or a complainant, not satisfied with a decision, may file a second suit/complaint in another\n",

      "were appointed to the posts. Instructions were given to the judges to be neutral and impartial; and\n",
      "complaints against them were taken seriously. Corrupt officials were removed. Consequently, the\n",
      "scales of justice were very high.3\n",
      "The procedure followed in civil cases was not much different from the procedure, which is applicable\n",
      "today. On a suit being filed, the court summoned the opposite party to admit or deny the claim.\n",
      "Issues were framed in the presence of both the parties who were then required to produce evidence\n",
      "in support of their respective claims. Simple cases were decided, based on such evidence, however,\n",
      "in complicated cases, the judge may launch his own investigation into the matter.4 Maximum effort\n",
      "was made to find the truth. On the conclusion of the proceedings, judgment was pronounced and\n",
      "duly executed. Litigants were allowed to present their cases either personally or through agents.\n",
      "Such agents were not exactly lawyers (in the modern sense of the term) but were fully conversant\n",

      "Company decided all cases of civil or criminal nature. The subsequent charters further expanded\n",

      "Introduction\n",
      "\n",
      "The roots of the current judicial system of Pakistan stretch back to the medieval period and even\n",
      "before. The judicial system that we practice today has evolved over a long period of time, spanning\n",
      "roughly over a whole millennium. The system has passed through several epochs, covering the\n",
      "Hindu era, Muslim period including the Mughal Empire, British colonial period and postindependence chapter. Notwithstanding the successive changes i.e. one rule/dynasty substituted\n",
      "by the other, which naturally resulted in the socio-economic and political transformation of the\n",
      "Indian society, the judicial system generally maintained a steady growth and gradual advance\n",
      "towards consolidation and improvement/refinement, without indeed, having to undergo any major\n",
      "disruption or breakdown.\n",
      "All in all, the system experienced and passed through 3 distinct stages of historical development,\n",
      "namely, Hindu Kingdom, Muslim Rule and British Colonial Administration. The 4th and current era,\n",
      "commenced with the partition of India and the establishment of Pakistan, as a sovereign and\n",
      "independent State. The system, thus, has evolved through a process of reform and development.\n",
      "This conclusion enjoys near unanimity among historians and commentators of Indian legal history.\n",
      "During this process of evolution and growth, the judicial system did receive influences and\n",
      "inspirations from foreign doctrines/notions and indigenous norms/practices, both in terms of\n",
      "organizing courts' structure, hierarchy, jurisdiction and adopting trial procedures/practices.\n",
      "Therefore, the present judicial system is not an entirely foreign transplant, as is commonly alleged,\n",
      "but has acquired an indigenous flavour and national colour. And whereas the system may not fully\n",
      "suit the genius of our people or meet the local conditions, its continued application and practice has\n",
      "made it intelligible to the common man. The very fact that increasing number of people are\n",
      "resorting to the courts for the resolution of their conflicts/disputes, indicates that the system enjoys\n",
      "a degree of legitimacy and acceptance.\n",

      "Historical Retrospect\n",
      "\n",
      "2.1\n",
      "Hindu Period\n",
      "The Hindu period lasts for 3 millennia i.e. from 1500 BC until 1500 AD. Information on the judicial\n",
      "system during Hindu period has been somewhat sketchy, gathered mostly from scattered sources,\n",
      "such as ancient books like Dharamshastra, Smiritis and Arthashastra, and commentaries of the same\n",
      "by historians and jurists. These sources construct a well-defined system of administration of justice\n",
      "during the Hindu period. The King was regarded as the fountain of justice who also discharged\n",
      "judicial functions. In this task, judges as well as his ministers and counselors assisted him. He was the\n",
      "final judicial authority and court of ultimate appeal. At the Capital, besides the King's Court, the\n",
      "Court of Chief Justice existed. This Court, in hierarchy, was next to the King's Court and appeal\n",
      "against its decisions lay to the King's Court. The judges were appointed on the basis of their\n",
      "qualifications and scholarship but the choice was mostly restricted to upper caste i.e. Brahmins.\n",
      "\n",
      "1\n",
      "\n",
      "\fThe Judicial System of Pakistan\n",
      "\n",
      "At the village level, tribunals dispensed justice, which consisted of the assembly of the village, or the\n",
      "caste or the family.1 The village Headman acted as Judge/Magistrate for the community. Decisions\n",
      "by such tribunals were usually through conciliation. The decisions of village/town courts/tribunals\n",
      "were appealable in the higher courts and final appeal lay before the King's Court. Besides\n",
      "adjudication, the system of arbitration was also in vogue.\n",
      "As regards the procedure followed in the courts/tribunals, no formal rules existed, as the law\n",
      "applicable was not statutory but customary or moral. The determination of truth and punishment of\n",
      "the wrong-doer was regarded as a religious duty. Civil proceedings commenced with the filing of a\n",
      "claim which was replied to by the opposite party. Both parties were allowed to produce witnesses so\n",
      "as to prove their respective claims. On the conclusion of the trial, decision was pronounced which\n",
      "was duly enforced. It appears thus, that the system of administration of justice, as it operated in\n",
      "ancient India, was not substantially different from what it is in the modern times. In a sense, the\n",
      "current system seems to be a continuation of the former practices and procedures.\n",
      "2.2\n",
      "Muslim Period\n",
      "The Muslim period in the Indian sub-continent roughly begins in the 11th century A.D. This period\n",
      "may be divided into two parts i.e. the period of early Muslim rulers who ruled Delhi and some other\n",
      "parts of India and the Mughal period, which replaced such Muslim and other rulers in 1526 A.D. The\n",
      "Mughal Dynasty lasted until the middle of 19th century.\n",
      "During the period of Muslim rulers, the Islamic law remained the law of the land in settling civil and\n",
      "criminal disputes. However, common customs and traditions were also invoked in settling secular\n",
      "matters. These rulers were not particularly keen on applying the Islamic law to each and every sphere\n",
      "of life, and let the indigenous customs and institutions continue side by side with Islamic law and\n",
      "institutions. During this period, different courts were established and functioned at the central,\n",
      "provincial, district and tehsil (Pargana) level. These courts had defined jurisdiction in civil, criminal\n",
      "and revenue matters and operated under the authority of the King. On the top of judicial hierarchy\n",
      "was the King's Court, presided over by the King himself, exercising original as well as appellate\n",
      "jurisdiction. The King was the head of judicial administration and he made all appointments to\n",
      "judicial posts. Persons of recognised scholarship, known competence and high integrity were\n",
      "appointed to such posts. The judges held office during the pleasure of the King.\n",
      "The Mughals improved upon the previous experience and created an organised system of\n",
      "administration of justice, all over the country. Courts were created at each and every unit of the\n",
      "administrative division. At the village level, the Hindu system of Panchayats (Council of Elders) was\n",
      "retained, which decided petty disputes of civil and criminal nature, using conciliation and mediation\n",
      "as means of settling disputes. At the town level, there existed courts, presided over by\n",

      "Qazi-e-Parganah. Similarly, at the district (Sarkar) and provincial (Subah) level, courts of Qazis were\n",
      "established. The highest court at the provincial level was that of Adalat Nazim-e-Subah. Similarly, for\n",
      "revenue cases, officers known as Ameen were appointed at the town level. At the district level,\n",
      "revenue cases were dealt with by Amalguzar and at the provincial level by Diwan.\n",
      "The supreme revenue court was called, the Imperial Diwan. Side by side, with civil and revenue\n",
      "courts, criminal courts, presided over by Faujdar, Kotwal, Shiqdar and Subedar functioned.2 The\n",
      "highest court of the land was the Emperor's Court, exercising original and appellate jurisdiction.\n",
      "Although these courts generally exercised exclusive jurisdiction in different categories of cases,\n",
      "however, sometimes their jurisdiction was inter-mixed, in as much as, officers dealing with criminal\n",
      "cases were also required to act as revenue courts. Furthermore, whereas territorially, these courts\n",
      "formed a concentric organization, their jurisdiction was not always exclusive on the basis of\n",
      "territorial limits. Thus, a plaintiff may choose to file his suit in a town or a district or a province. The\n",
      "pecuniary jurisdiction of the courts was also not defined; hence, a case of higher value may be filed in\n",
      "a court of small town. Similarly, appellate jurisdiction existed but was not well defined. Thus, a\n",
      "plaintiff or a complainant, not satisfied with a decision, may file a second suit/complaint in another\n",
      "court. Such later court would decide the matter afresh, without indeed taking into consideration\n",
      "the earlier finding of the court.\n",
      "The emperor made the judicial appointments and persons of high scholarship and good reputation\n",
      "were appointed to the posts. Instructions were given to the judges to be neutral and impartial; and\n",
      "complaints against them were taken seriously. Corrupt officials were removed. Consequently, the\n",
      "scales of justice were very high.3\n",
      "The procedure followed in civil cases was not much different from the procedure, which is applicable\n",
      "today. On a suit being filed, the court summoned the opposite party to admit or deny the claim.\n",
      "Issues were framed in the presence of both the parties who were then required to produce evidence\n",
      "in support of their respective claims. Simple cases were decided, based on such evidence, however,\n",
      "in complicated cases, the judge may launch his own investigation into the matter.4 Maximum effort\n",
      "was made to find the truth. On the conclusion of the proceedings, judgment was pronounced and\n",
      "duly executed. Litigants were allowed to present their cases either personally or through agents.\n",
      "Such agents were not exactly lawyers (in the modern sense of the term) but were fully conversant\n",
      "with the judicial procedure. An officer of the court called Mufti, attached to the court, made the\n",

      "British Period\n",
      "The East India Company was authorized by the Charter of 1623 to decide the cases of its English\n",
      "employees. The Company therefore established its own courts. The President and Council of the\n",
      "Company decided all cases of civil or criminal nature. The subsequent charters further expanded\n",
      "such powers. Thus, the Charter of 1661 authorized the Governor and Council to decide not only the\n",
      "cases of the Company employees but also of persons residing in the settlements. In deciding such\n",
      "cases, the Governor and the Council applied the English laws. As the character of the Company\n",
      "changed from one of a trading concern into a territorial power, newer and additional courts were\n",
      "established for deciding cases and settling disputes of its employees and subjects. The\n",
      "administration of justice was initially confined to the Presidency Town of Bombay, Calcutta and\n",
      "Madras. In view of the huge distances between these Towns and the peculiar conditions prevailing\n",
      "there, the administration of justice, which developed in these Towns, was not uniform. There were\n",
      "established two sets of courts, one for the Presidency Towns and the other for the Mufussil. The\n",
      "principal courts for the town were known as the Supreme Courts and Recorders Courts. These courts\n",
      "consisted of English judges and applied English laws. The English people, residing in such towns\n",
      "alone, were subject to their jurisdiction. The native inhabitants, who were mostly living in the\n",
      "Mufussil, were governed under separate courts called Sadar Dewani Adalat and Sadar Nizamat\n",
      "Adalat, dealing with civil and criminal cases respectively. Such courts applied the local laws and\n",
      "regulations.\n",
      "The Supreme Court of Calcutta was established under the Regulating Act 1773. The Court consisted\n",
      "of a Chief Justice and other judges, exercising both civil and criminal jurisdiction. The Court could\n",
      "also issue certain prerogative writs. In 1798, the Recorders Courts were established at Madras and\n",
      "Bombay, with powers identical to the Supreme Court of Calcutta. Afterwards, the Recorders Court at\n",
      "Madras was substituted by the Supreme Court (under the Parliament Act 1800). A few years later, the\n",
      "Recorders Court at Bombay was also replaced by the Supreme Court (under the Parliament Act\n",
      "1823). These new courts had indeed the same composition, jurisdiction and powers as exercised by\n",
      "the Supreme Court of Calcutta.\n",
      "The High Court of Judicature Act 1861 abolished the Supreme Courts as well as the Sadar Adalats,\n",
      "and in their place, constituted the High Court of Judicature for each Presidency Town. This Court\n",
      "consisted of a Chief Justice and such other number of judges, not exceeding 15. The Act prescribed\n",
      "professional qualifications for such judges together with the mode of their appointment. Thus, it\n",
      "was provided that 1/3rd of the judges should be appointed from amongst the barristers with 5 years\n",
      "standing and 1/3rd from amongst the civil servants, having 3 years experience as a District Judge.\n",
      "The remaining 1/3rd seats were filled from amongst pleaders and members of Subordinate\n",
      "Judiciary, having 5 years experience. The judges were appointed by the Crown and held office\n",
      "during his pleasure. The High Courts exercised original as well as appellate jurisdiction in civil and\n",
      "criminal matters and were also required to supervise the functioning of the Subordinate Courts in\n",
      "their respective domain. Besides the Presidency Towns, High Courts were also established in\n",
