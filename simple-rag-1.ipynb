      "\fThe Judicial System of Pakistan\n",
      "1.\n",
      "Introduction\n",
      "The roots of the current judicial system of Pakistan stretch back to the medieval period and even\n",
      "before. The judicial system that we practice today has evolved over a long period of time, spanning\n",
      "roughly over a whole millennium. The system has passed through several epochs, covering the\n",
      "Hindu era, Muslim period including the Mughal Empire, British colonial period and postindependence chapter. Notwithstanding the successive changes i.e. one rule/dynasty substituted\n",
      "by the other, which naturally resulted in the socio-economic and political transformation of the\n",
      "Indian society, the judicial system generally maintained a steady growth and gradual advance\n",
      "towards consolidation and improvement/refinement, without indeed, having to undergo any major\n",
      "disruption or breakdown.\n",
      "All in all, the system experienced and passed through 3 distinct stages of historical development,\n",
      "namely, Hindu Kingdom, Muslim Rule and British Colonial Administration. The 4th and current era,\n",
      "commenced with the partition of India and the establishment of Pakistan, as a sovereign and\n",
      "independent State. The system, thus, has evolved through a process of reform and development.\n",
      "This conclusion enjoys near unanimity among historians and commentators of Indian legal history.\n",
      "During this process of evolution and growth, the judicial system did receive influences and\n",
      "inspirations from foreign doctrines/notions and indigenous norms/practices, both in terms of\n",
      "organizing courts' structure, hierarchy, jurisdiction and adopting trial procedures/practices.\n",
      "Therefore, the present judicial system is not an entirely foreign transplant, as is commonly alleged,\n",
      "but has acquired an indigenous flavour and national colour. And whereas the system may not fully\n",
      "suit the genius of our people or meet the local conditions, its continued application and practice has\n",
      "made it intelligible to the common man. The very fact that increasing number of people are\n",
      "resorting to the courts for the resolution of their conflicts/disputes, indicates that the system enjoys\n",
      "a degree of legitimacy and acceptance.\n",
      "2.\n",
      "Historical Retrospect\n",
      "2.1\n",
      "Hindu Period\n",
      "The Hindu period lasts for 3 millennia i.e. from 1500 BC until 1500 AD. Information on the judicial\n",
      "system during Hindu period has been somewhat sketchy, gathered mostly from scattered sources,\n",
      "such as ancient books like Dharamshastra, Smiritis and Arthashastra, and commentaries of the same\n",
      "by historians and jurists. These sources construct a well-defined system of administration of justice\n",
      "during the Hindu period. The King was regarded as the fountain of justice who also discharged\n",
      "judicial functions. In this task, judges as well as his ministers and counselors assisted him. He was the\n",
      "final judicial authority and court of ultimate appeal. At the Capital, besides the King's Court, the\n",
      "Court of Chief Justice existed. This Court, in hierarchy, was next to the King's Court and appeal\n",
      "against its decisions lay to the King's Court. The judges were appointed on the basis of their\n",
      "qualifications and scholarship but the choice was mostly restricted to upper caste i.e. Brahmins.\n",
      "1\n",
      "\fThe Judicial System of Pakistan\n",
      "At the village level, tribunals dispensed justice, which consisted of the assembly of the village, or the\n",
      "caste or the family.1 The village Headman acted as Judge/Magistrate for the community. Decisions\n",
      "by such tribunals were usually through conciliation. The decisions of village/town courts/tribunals\n",
      "were appealable in the higher courts and final appeal lay before the King's Court. Besides\n",
      "adjudication, the system of arbitration was also in vogue.\n",
      "As regards the procedure followed in the courts/tribunals, no formal rules existed, as the law\n",
      "applicable was not statutory but customary or moral. The determination of truth and punishment of\n",
      "the wrong-doer was regarded as a religious duty. Civil proceedings commenced with the filing of a\n",
      "claim which was replied to by the opposite party. Both parties were allowed to produce witnesses so\n",
      "as to prove their respective claims. On the conclusion of the trial, decision was pronounced which\n",
      "was duly enforced. It appears thus, that the system of administration of justice, as it operated in\n",
      "ancient India, was not substantially different from what it is in the modern times. In a sense, the\n",
      "current system seems to be a continuation of the former practices and procedures.\n",
      "2.2\n",
      "Muslim Period\n",
      "The Muslim period in the Indian sub-continent roughly begins in the 11th century A.D. This period\n",
      "may be divided into two parts i.e. the period of early Muslim rulers who ruled Delhi and some other\n",
      "parts of India and the Mughal period, which replaced such Muslim and other rulers in 1526 A.D. The\n",
      "Mughal Dynasty lasted until the middle of 19th century.\n",
      "During the period of Muslim rulers, the Islamic law remained the law of the land in settling civil and\n",
      "criminal disputes. However, common customs and traditions were also invoked in settling secular\n",
      "matters. These rulers were not particularly keen on applying the Islamic law to each and every sphere\n",
      "of life, and let the indigenous customs and institutions continue side by side with Islamic law and\n",
      "institutions. During this period, different courts were established and functioned at the central,\n",
      "provincial, district and tehsil (Pargana) level. These courts had defined jurisdiction in civil, criminal\n",
      "and revenue matters and operated under the authority of the King. On the top of judicial hierarchy\n",
      "was the King's Court, presided over by the King himself, exercising original as well as appellate\n",
      "jurisdiction. The King was the head of judicial administration and he made all appointments to\n",
      "judicial posts. Persons of recognised scholarship, known competence and high integrity were\n",
      "appointed to such posts. The judges held office during the pleasure of the King.\n",
      "The Mughals improved upon the previous experience and created an organised system of\n",
      "administration of justice, all over the country. Courts were created at each and every unit of the\n",
      "administrative division. At the village level, the Hindu system of Panchayats (Council of Elders) was\n",
      "retained, which decided petty disputes of civil and criminal nature, using conciliation and mediation\n",
      "as means of settling disputes. At the town level, there existed courts, presided over by\n",

      "Qazi-e-Parganah. Similarly, at the district (Sarkar) and provincial (Subah) level, courts of Qazis were\n",
      "established. The highest court at the provincial level was that of Adalat Nazim-e-Subah. Similarly, for\n",
      "revenue cases, officers known as Ameen were appointed at the town level. At the district level,\n",
      "revenue cases were dealt with by Amalguzar and at the provincial level by Diwan.\n",
      "The supreme revenue court was called, the Imperial Diwan. Side by side, with civil and revenue\n",
      "courts, criminal courts, presided over by Faujdar, Kotwal, Shiqdar and Subedar functioned.2 The\n",
      "highest court of the land was the Emperor's Court, exercising original and appellate jurisdiction.\n",
      "Although these courts generally exercised exclusive jurisdiction in different categories of cases,\n",
      "however, sometimes their jurisdiction was inter-mixed, in as much as, officers dealing with criminal\n",
      "cases were also required to act as revenue courts. Furthermore, whereas territorially, these courts\n",
      "formed a concentric organization, their jurisdiction was not always exclusive on the basis of\n",
      "territorial limits. Thus, a plaintiff may choose to file his suit in a town or a district or a province. The\n",
      "pecuniary jurisdiction of the courts was also not defined; hence, a case of higher value may be filed in\n",
      "a court of small town. Similarly, appellate jurisdiction existed but was not well defined. Thus, a\n",
      "plaintiff or a complainant, not satisfied with a decision, may file a second suit/complaint in another\n",
      "court. Such later court would decide the matter afresh, without indeed taking into consideration\n",
      "the earlier finding of the court.\n",
      "The emperor made the judicial appointments and persons of high scholarship and good reputation\n",
      "were appointed to the posts. Instructions were given to the judges to be neutral and impartial; and\n",
      "complaints against them were taken seriously. Corrupt officials were removed. Consequently, the\n",
      "scales of justice were very high.3\n",
      "The procedure followed in civil cases was not much different from the procedure, which is applicable\n",
      "today. On a suit being filed, the court summoned the opposite party to admit or deny the claim.\n",
      "Issues were framed in the presence of both the parties who were then required to produce evidence\n",
      "in support of their respective claims. Simple cases were decided, based on such evidence, however,\n",
      "in complicated cases, the judge may launch his own investigation into the matter.4 Maximum effort\n",
      "was made to find the truth. On the conclusion of the proceedings, judgment was pronounced and\n",
      "duly executed. Litigants were allowed to present their cases either personally or through agents.\n",
      "Such agents were not exactly lawyers (in the modern sense of the term) but were fully conversant\n",
      "with the judicial procedure. An officer of the court called Mufti, attached to the court, made the\n",
      "interpretation of law.5\n",

      "British Period\n",
      "The East India Company was authorized by the Charter of 1623 to decide the cases of its English\n",
      "employees. The Company therefore established its own courts. The President and Council of the\n",
      "Company decided all cases of civil or criminal nature. The subsequent charters further expanded\n",
      "such powers. Thus, the Charter of 1661 authorized the Governor and Council to decide not only the\n",
      "cases of the Company employees but also of persons residing in the settlements. In deciding such\n",
      "cases, the Governor and the Council applied the English laws. As the character of the Company\n",
      "changed from one of a trading concern into a territorial power, newer and additional courts were\n",
      "established for deciding cases and settling disputes of its employees and subjects. The\n",
      "administration of justice was initially confined to the Presidency Town of Bombay, Calcutta and\n",
      "Madras. In view of the huge distances between these Towns and the peculiar conditions prevailing\n",
      "there, the administration of justice, which developed in these Towns, was not uniform. There were\n",
      "established two sets of courts, one for the Presidency Towns and the other for the Mufussil. The\n",
      "principal courts for the town were known as the Supreme Courts and Recorders Courts. These courts\n",
      "consisted of English judges and applied English laws. The English people, residing in such towns\n",
      "alone, were subject to their jurisdiction. The native inhabitants, who were mostly living in the\n",
      "Mufussil, were governed under separate courts called Sadar Dewani Adalat and Sadar Nizamat\n",
      "Adalat, dealing with civil and criminal cases respectively. Such courts applied the local laws and\n",
      "regulations.\n",
      "The Supreme Court of Calcutta was established under the Regulating Act 1773. The Court consisted\n",
      "of a Chief Justice and other judges, exercising both civil and criminal jurisdiction. The Court could\n",
      "also issue certain prerogative writs. In 1798, the Recorders Courts were established at Madras and\n",
      "Bombay, with powers identical to the Supreme Court of Calcutta. Afterwards, the Recorders Court at\n",
      "Madras was substituted by the Supreme Court (under the Parliament Act 1800). A few years later, the\n",
      "Recorders Court at Bombay was also replaced by the Supreme Court (under the Parliament Act\n",
      "1823). These new courts had indeed the same composition, jurisdiction and powers as exercised by\n",
      "the Supreme Court of Calcutta.\n",
      "The High Court of Judicature Act 1861 abolished the Supreme Courts as well as the Sadar Adalats,\n",
      "and in their place, constituted the High Court of Judicature for each Presidency Town. This Court\n",
      "consisted of a Chief Justice and such other number of judges, not exceeding 15. The Act prescribed\n",
      "professional qualifications for such judges together with the mode of their appointment. Thus, it\n",
      "was provided that 1/3rd of the judges should be appointed from amongst the barristers with 5 years\n",
      "standing and 1/3rd from amongst the civil servants, having 3 years experience as a District Judge.\n",
      "The remaining 1/3rd seats were filled from amongst pleaders and members of Subordinate\n",
      "Judiciary, having 5 years experience. The judges were appointed by the Crown and held office\n",
      "during his pleasure. The High Courts exercised original as well as appellate jurisdiction in civil and\n",
      "criminal matters and were also required to supervise the functioning of the Subordinate Courts in\n",
      "their respective domain. Besides the Presidency Towns, High Courts were also established in\n",
