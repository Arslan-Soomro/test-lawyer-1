      "\n",
      "The roots of the current judicial system of Pakistan stretch back to the medieval period and even\n",
      "before. The judicial system that we practice today has evolved over a long period of time, spanning\n",
      "roughly over a whole millennium. The system has passed through several epochs, covering the\n",
      "Hindu era, Muslim period including the Mughal Empire, British colonial period and postindependence chapter. Notwithstanding the successive changes i.e. one rule/dynasty substituted\n",
      "by the other, which naturally resulted in the socio-economic and political transformation of the\n",
      "Indian society, the judicial system generally maintained a steady growth and gradual advance\n",
      "towards consolidation and improvement/refinement, without indeed, having to undergo any major\n",
      "disruption or breakdown.\n",
      "All in all, the system experienced and passed through 3 distinct stages of historical development,\n",
      "namely, Hindu Kingdom, Muslim Rule and British Colonial Administration. The 4th and current era,\n",
      "commenced with the partition of India and the establishment of Pakistan, as a sovereign and\n",
      "independent State. The system, thus, has evolved through a process of reform and development.\n",
      "This conclusion enjoys near unanimity among historians and commentators of Indian legal history.\n",
      "During this process of evolution and growth, the judicial system did receive influences and\n",
      "inspirations from foreign doctrines/notions and indigenous norms/practices, both in terms of\n",
      "organizing courts' structure, hierarchy, jurisdiction and adopting trial procedures/practices.\n",
      "Therefore, the present judicial system is not an entirely foreign transplant, as is commonly alleged,\n",
      "but has acquired an indigenous flavour and national colour. And whereas the system may not fully\n",
      "suit the genius of our people or meet the local conditions, its continued application and practice has\n",
      "made it intelligible to the common man. The very fact that increasing number of people are\n",
      "resorting to the courts for the resolution of their conflicts/disputes, indicates that the system enjoys\n",
      "a degree of legitimacy and acceptance.\n",

      "2.1\n",
      "Hindu Period\n",
      "The Hindu period lasts for 3 millennia i.e. from 1500 BC until 1500 AD. Information on the judicial\n",
      "system during Hindu period has been somewhat sketchy, gathered mostly from scattered sources,\n",
      "such as ancient books like Dharamshastra, Smiritis and Arthashastra, and commentaries of the same\n",
      "by historians and jurists. These sources construct a well-defined system of administration of justice\n",
      "during the Hindu period. The King was regarded as the fountain of justice who also discharged\n",
      "judicial functions. In this task, judges as well as his ministers and counselors assisted him. He was the\n",
      "final judicial authority and court of ultimate appeal. At the Capital, besides the King's Court, the\n",
      "Court of Chief Justice existed. This Court, in hierarchy, was next to the King's Court and appeal\n",
      "against its decisions lay to the King's Court. The judges were appointed on the basis of their\n",
      "qualifications and scholarship but the choice was mostly restricted to upper caste i.e. Brahmins.\n",
      "\n",
      "1\n",
      "\n",
      "\fThe Judicial System of Pakistan\n",
      "\n",
      "At the village level, tribunals dispensed justice, which consisted of the assembly of the village, or the\n",
      "caste or the family.1 The village Headman acted as Judge/Magistrate for the community. Decisions\n",
      "by such tribunals were usually through conciliation. The decisions of village/town courts/tribunals\n",
      "were appealable in the higher courts and final appeal lay before the King's Court. Besides\n",
      "adjudication, the system of arbitration was also in vogue.\n",
      "As regards the procedure followed in the courts/tribunals, no formal rules existed, as the law\n",
      "applicable was not statutory but customary or moral. The determination of truth and punishment of\n",
      "the wrong-doer was regarded as a religious duty. Civil proceedings commenced with the filing of a\n",
      "claim which was replied to by the opposite party. Both parties were allowed to produce witnesses so\n",
      "as to prove their respective claims. On the conclusion of the trial, decision was pronounced which\n",
      "was duly enforced. It appears thus, that the system of administration of justice, as it operated in\n",
      "ancient India, was not substantially different from what it is in the modern times. In a sense, the\n",
      "current system seems to be a continuation of the former practices and procedures.\n",
      "2.2\n",
      "Muslim Period\n",
      "The Muslim period in the Indian sub-continent roughly begins in the 11th century A.D. This period\n",
      "may be divided into two parts i.e. the period of early Muslim rulers who ruled Delhi and some other\n",
      "parts of India and the Mughal period, which replaced such Muslim and other rulers in 1526 A.D. The\n",
      "Mughal Dynasty lasted until the middle of 19th century.\n",
      "During the period of Muslim rulers, the Islamic law remained the law of the land in settling civil and\n",
      "criminal disputes. However, common customs and traditions were also invoked in settling secular\n",
      "matters. These rulers were not particularly keen on applying the Islamic law to each and every sphere\n",
      "of life, and let the indigenous customs and institutions continue side by side with Islamic law and\n",
      "institutions. During this period, different courts were established and functioned at the central,\n",
      "provincial, district and tehsil (Pargana) level. These courts had defined jurisdiction in civil, criminal\n",
      "and revenue matters and operated under the authority of the King. On the top of judicial hierarchy\n",
      "was the King's Court, presided over by the King himself, exercising original as well as appellate\n",
      "jurisdiction. The King was the head of judicial administration and he made all appointments to\n",
      "judicial posts. Persons of recognised scholarship, known competence and high integrity were\n",
      "appointed to such posts. The judges held office during the pleasure of the King.\n",
      "The Mughals improved upon the previous experience and created an organised system of\n",
      "administration of justice, all over the country. Courts were created at each and every unit of the\n",
      "administrative division. At the village level, the Hindu system of Panchayats (Council of Elders) was\n",
      "retained, which decided petty disputes of civil and criminal nature, using conciliation and mediation\n",
      "as means of settling disputes. At the town level, there existed courts, presided over by\n",

      "Qazi-e-Parganah. Similarly, at the district (Sarkar) and provincial (Subah) level, courts of Qazis were\n",
      "established. The highest court at the provincial level was that of Adalat Nazim-e-Subah. Similarly, for\n",
      "revenue cases, officers known as Ameen were appointed at the town level. At the district level,\n",
      "revenue cases were dealt with by Amalguzar and at the provincial level by Diwan.\n",
      "The supreme revenue court was called, the Imperial Diwan. Side by side, with civil and revenue\n",
      "courts, criminal courts, presided over by Faujdar, Kotwal, Shiqdar and Subedar functioned.2 The\n",
      "highest court of the land was the Emperor's Court, exercising original and appellate jurisdiction.\n",
      "Although these courts generally exercised exclusive jurisdiction in different categories of cases,\n",
      "however, sometimes their jurisdiction was inter-mixed, in as much as, officers dealing with criminal\n",
      "cases were also required to act as revenue courts. Furthermore, whereas territorially, these courts\n",
      "formed a concentric organization, their jurisdiction was not always exclusive on the basis of\n",
      "territorial limits. Thus, a plaintiff may choose to file his suit in a town or a district or a province. The\n",
      "pecuniary jurisdiction of the courts was also not defined; hence, a case of higher value may be filed in\n",
      "a court of small town. Similarly, appellate jurisdiction existed but was not well defined. Thus, a\n",
      "plaintiff or a complainant, not satisfied with a decision, may file a second suit/complaint in another\n",
      "court. Such later court would decide the matter afresh, without indeed taking into consideration\n",
      "the earlier finding of the court.\n",
      "The emperor made the judicial appointments and persons of high scholarship and good reputation\n",
      "were appointed to the posts. Instructions were given to the judges to be neutral and impartial; and\n",
      "complaints against them were taken seriously. Corrupt officials were removed. Consequently, the\n",
      "scales of justice were very high.3\n",
      "The procedure followed in civil cases was not much different from the procedure, which is applicable\n",
      "today. On a suit being filed, the court summoned the opposite party to admit or deny the claim.\n",
      "Issues were framed in the presence of both the parties who were then required to produce evidence\n",
      "in support of their respective claims. Simple cases were decided, based on such evidence, however,\n",
      "in complicated cases, the judge may launch his own investigation into the matter.4 Maximum effort\n",
      "was made to find the truth. On the conclusion of the proceedings, judgment was pronounced and\n",
      "duly executed. Litigants were allowed to present their cases either personally or through agents.\n",
      "Such agents were not exactly lawyers (in the modern sense of the term) but were fully conversant\n",
      "with the judicial procedure. An officer of the court called Mufti, attached to the court, made the\n",

      "The East India Company was authorized by the Charter of 1623 to decide the cases of its English\n",
      "employees. The Company therefore established its own courts. The President and Council of the\n",
      "Company decided all cases of civil or criminal nature. The subsequent charters further expanded\n",
      "such powers. Thus, the Charter of 1661 authorized the Governor and Council to decide not only the\n",
      "cases of the Company employees but also of persons residing in the settlements. In deciding such\n",
      "cases, the Governor and the Council applied the English laws. As the character of the Company\n",
      "changed from one of a trading concern into a territorial power, newer and additional courts were\n",
      "established for deciding cases and settling disputes of its employees and subjects. The\n",
      "administration of justice was initially confined to the Presidency Town of Bombay, Calcutta and\n",
      "Madras. In view of the huge distances between these Towns and the peculiar conditions prevailing\n",
      "there, the administration of justice, which developed in these Towns, was not uniform. There were\n",
      "established two sets of courts, one for the Presidency Towns and the other for the Mufussil. The\n",
      "principal courts for the town were known as the Supreme Courts and Recorders Courts. These courts\n",
      "consisted of English judges and applied English laws. The English people, residing in such towns\n",
      "alone, were subject to their jurisdiction. The native inhabitants, who were mostly living in the\n",
      "Mufussil, were governed under separate courts called Sadar Dewani Adalat and Sadar Nizamat\n",
      "Adalat, dealing with civil and criminal cases respectively. Such courts applied the local laws and\n",
      "regulations.\n",
      "The Supreme Court of Calcutta was established under the Regulating Act 1773. The Court consisted\n",
      "of a Chief Justice and other judges, exercising both civil and criminal jurisdiction. The Court could\n",
      "also issue certain prerogative writs. In 1798, the Recorders Courts were established at Madras and\n",
      "Bombay, with powers identical to the Supreme Court of Calcutta. Afterwards, the Recorders Court at\n",
      "Madras was substituted by the Supreme Court (under the Parliament Act 1800). A few years later, the\n",
      "Recorders Court at Bombay was also replaced by the Supreme Court (under the Parliament Act\n",
      "1823). These new courts had indeed the same composition, jurisdiction and powers as exercised by\n",
      "the Supreme Court of Calcutta.\n",
      "The High Court of Judicature Act 1861 abolished the Supreme Courts as well as the Sadar Adalats,\n",
      "and in their place, constituted the High Court of Judicature for each Presidency Town. This Court\n",
      "consisted of a Chief Justice and such other number of judges, not exceeding 15. The Act prescribed\n",
      "professional qualifications for such judges together with the mode of their appointment. Thus, it\n",
      "was provided that 1/3rd of the judges should be appointed from amongst the barristers with 5 years\n",

      "The remaining 1/3rd seats were filled from amongst pleaders and members of Subordinate\n",

      "during his pleasure. The High Courts exercised original as well as appellate jurisdiction in civil and\n",
      "criminal matters and were also required to supervise the functioning of the Subordinate Courts in\n",
      "their respective domain. Besides the Presidency Towns, High Courts were also established in\n",

      "\fThe Judicial System of Pakistan\n",
      "1.\n",
      "Introduction\n",
      "The roots of the current judicial system of Pakistan stretch back to the medieval period and even\n",
      "before. The judicial system that we practice today has evolved over a long period of time, spanning\n",
      "roughly over a whole millennium. The system has passed through several epochs, covering the\n",
      "Hindu era, Muslim period including the Mughal Empire, British colonial period and postindependence chapter. Notwithstanding the successive changes i.e. one rule/dynasty substituted\n",
      "by the other, which naturally resulted in the socio-economic and political transformation of the\n",
      "Indian society, the judicial system generally maintained a steady growth and gradual advance\n",
      "towards consolidation and improvement/refinement, without indeed, having to undergo any major\n",
      "disruption or breakdown.\n",
      "All in all, the system experienced and passed through 3 distinct stages of historical development,\n",
      "namely, Hindu Kingdom, Muslim Rule and British Colonial Administration. The 4th and current era,\n",
      "commenced with the partition of India and the establishment of Pakistan, as a sovereign and\n",
      "independent State. The system, thus, has evolved through a process of reform and development.\n",
      "This conclusion enjoys near unanimity among historians and commentators of Indian legal history.\n",
      "During this process of evolution and growth, the judicial system did receive influences and\n",
      "inspirations from foreign doctrines/notions and indigenous norms/practices, both in terms of\n",
      "organizing courts' structure, hierarchy, jurisdiction and adopting trial procedures/practices.\n",
      "Therefore, the present judicial system is not an entirely foreign transplant, as is commonly alleged,\n",
      "but has acquired an indigenous flavour and national colour. And whereas the system may not fully\n",
      "suit the genius of our people or meet the local conditions, its continued application and practice has\n",
      "made it intelligible to the common man. The very fact that increasing number of people are\n",
      "resorting to the courts for the resolution of their conflicts/disputes, indicates that the system enjoys\n",
      "a degree of legitimacy and acceptance.\n",
      "2.\n",
      "Historical Retrospect\n",
      "2.1\n",
      "Hindu Period\n",
      "The Hindu period lasts for 3 millennia i.e. from 1500 BC until 1500 AD. Information on the judicial\n",
      "system during Hindu period has been somewhat sketchy, gathered mostly from scattered sources,\n",
      "such as ancient books like Dharamshastra, Smiritis and Arthashastra, and commentaries of the same\n",
      "by historians and jurists. These sources construct a well-defined system of administration of justice\n",
      "during the Hindu period. The King was regarded as the fountain of justice who also discharged\n",
      "judicial functions. In this task, judges as well as his ministers and counselors assisted him. He was the\n",
      "final judicial authority and court of ultimate appeal. At the Capital, besides the King's Court, the\n",
      "Court of Chief Justice existed. This Court, in hierarchy, was next to the King's Court and appeal\n",
      "against its decisions lay to the King's Court. The judges were appointed on the basis of their\n",
      "qualifications and scholarship but the choice was mostly restricted to upper caste i.e. Brahmins.\n",
      "1\n",
      "\fThe Judicial System of Pakistan\n",
      "At the village level, tribunals dispensed justice, which consisted of the assembly of the village, or the\n",
      "caste or the family.1 The village Headman acted as Judge/Magistrate for the community. Decisions\n",
      "by such tribunals were usually through conciliation. The decisions of village/town courts/tribunals\n",
      "were appealable in the higher courts and final appeal lay before the King's Court. Besides\n",
      "adjudication, the system of arbitration was also in vogue.\n",
      "As regards the procedure followed in the courts/tribunals, no formal rules existed, as the law\n",
      "applicable was not statutory but customary or moral. The determination of truth and punishment of\n",
      "the wrong-doer was regarded as a religious duty. Civil proceedings commenced with the filing of a\n",
      "claim which was replied to by the opposite party. Both parties were allowed to produce witnesses so\n",
      "as to prove their respective claims. On the conclusion of the trial, decision was pronounced which\n",
      "was duly enforced. It appears thus, that the system of administration of justice, as it operated in\n",
      "ancient India, was not substantially different from what it is in the modern times. In a sense, the\n",
      "current system seems to be a continuation of the former practices and procedures.\n",
      "2.2\n",
      "Muslim Period\n",
      "The Muslim period in the Indian sub-continent roughly begins in the 11th century A.D. This period\n",
      "may be divided into two parts i.e. the period of early Muslim rulers who ruled Delhi and some other\n",
      "parts of India and the Mughal period, which replaced such Muslim and other rulers in 1526 A.D. The\n",
      "Mughal Dynasty lasted until the middle of 19th century.\n",
      "During the period of Muslim rulers, the Islamic law remained the law of the land in settling civil and\n",
      "criminal disputes. However, common customs and traditions were also invoked in settling secular\n",
      "matters. These rulers were not particularly keen on applying the Islamic law to each and every sphere\n",
      "of life, and let the indigenous customs and institutions continue side by side with Islamic law and\n",
      "institutions. During this period, different courts were established and functioned at the central,\n",
      "provincial, district and tehsil (Pargana) level. These courts had defined jurisdiction in civil, criminal\n",
      "and revenue matters and operated under the authority of the King. On the top of judicial hierarchy\n",
      "was the King's Court, presided over by the King himself, exercising original as well as appellate\n",
      "jurisdiction. The King was the head of judicial administration and he made all appointments to\n",
      "judicial posts. Persons of recognised scholarship, known competence and high integrity were\n",
      "appointed to such posts. The judges held office during the pleasure of the King.\n",
      "The Mughals improved upon the previous experience and created an organised system of\n",
      "administration of justice, all over the country. Courts were created at each and every unit of the\n",
      "administrative division. At the village level, the Hindu system of Panchayats (Council of Elders) was\n",
      "retained, which decided petty disputes of civil and criminal nature, using conciliation and mediation\n",
      "as means of settling disputes. At the town level, there existed courts, presided over by\n",
      "th Report of Law Commission of India, 1958, Vol. I, p 26\n",
      "2\n",
      "\fThe Judicial System of Pakistan\n",
      "Qazi-e-Parganah. Similarly, at the district (Sarkar) and provincial (Subah) level, courts of Qazis were\n",
      "established. The highest court at the provincial level was that of Adalat Nazim-e-Subah. Similarly, for\n",
      "revenue cases, officers known as Ameen were appointed at the town level. At the district level,\n",
      "revenue cases were dealt with by Amalguzar and at the provincial level by Diwan.\n",
      "The supreme revenue court was called, the Imperial Diwan. Side by side, with civil and revenue\n",
      "courts, criminal courts, presided over by Faujdar, Kotwal, Shiqdar and Subedar functioned.2 The\n",
      "highest court of the land was the Emperor's Court, exercising original and appellate jurisdiction.\n",
      "Although these courts generally exercised exclusive jurisdiction in different categories of cases,\n",
      "however, sometimes their jurisdiction was inter-mixed, in as much as, officers dealing with criminal\n",
      "cases were also required to act as revenue courts. Furthermore, whereas territorially, these courts\n",
      "formed a concentric organization, their jurisdiction was not always exclusive on the basis of\n",
      "territorial limits. Thus, a plaintiff may choose to file his suit in a town or a district or a province. The\n",
      "pecuniary jurisdiction of the courts was also not defined; hence, a case of higher value may be filed in\n",
      "a court of small town. Similarly, appellate jurisdiction existed but was not well defined. Thus, a\n",
      "plaintiff or a complainant, not satisfied with a decision, may file a second suit/complaint in another\n",
      "court. Such later court would decide the matter afresh, without indeed taking into consideration\n",
      "the earlier finding of the court.\n",
      "The emperor made the judicial appointments and persons of high scholarship and good reputation\n",
      "were appointed to the posts. Instructions were given to the judges to be neutral and impartial; and\n",
      "complaints against them were taken seriously. Corrupt officials were removed. Consequently, the\n",
      "scales of justice were very high.3\n",
      "The procedure followed in civil cases was not much different from the procedure, which is applicable\n",
      "today. On a suit being filed, the court summoned the opposite party to admit or deny the claim.\n",
      "Issues were framed in the presence of both the parties who were then required to produce evidence\n",
      "in support of their respective claims. Simple cases were decided, based on such evidence, however,\n",
      "in complicated cases, the judge may launch his own investigation into the matter.4 Maximum effort\n",
      "was made to find the truth. On the conclusion of the proceedings, judgment was pronounced and\n",
      "duly executed. Litigants were allowed to present their cases either personally or through agents.\n",
      "Such agents were not exactly lawyers (in the modern sense of the term) but were fully conversant\n",
      "with the judicial procedure. An officer of the court called Mufti, attached to the court, made the\n",
      "interpretation of law.5\n",

      "British Period\n",
      "The East India Company was authorized by the Charter of 1623 to decide the cases of its English\n",
      "employees. The Company therefore established its own courts. The President and Council of the\n",
      "Company decided all cases of civil or criminal nature. The subsequent charters further expanded\n",
      "such powers. Thus, the Charter of 1661 authorized the Governor and Council to decide not only the\n",
      "cases of the Company employees but also of persons residing in the settlements. In deciding such\n",
      "cases, the Governor and the Council applied the English laws. As the character of the Company\n",
      "changed from one of a trading concern into a territorial power, newer and additional courts were\n",
      "established for deciding cases and settling disputes of its employees and subjects. The\n",
      "administration of justice was initially confined to the Presidency Town of Bombay, Calcutta and\n",
      "Madras. In view of the huge distances between these Towns and the peculiar conditions prevailing\n",
      "there, the administration of justice, which developed in these Towns, was not uniform. There were\n",
      "established two sets of courts, one for the Presidency Towns and the other for the Mufussil. The\n",
      "principal courts for the town were known as the Supreme Courts and Recorders Courts. These courts\n",
      "consisted of English judges and applied English laws. The English people, residing in such towns\n",
      "alone, were subject to their jurisdiction. The native inhabitants, who were mostly living in the\n",
      "Mufussil, were governed under separate courts called Sadar Dewani Adalat and Sadar Nizamat\n",
      "Adalat, dealing with civil and criminal cases respectively. Such courts applied the local laws and\n",
      "regulations.\n",
      "The Supreme Court of Calcutta was established under the Regulating Act 1773. The Court consisted\n",
      "of a Chief Justice and other judges, exercising both civil and criminal jurisdiction. The Court could\n",
      "also issue certain prerogative writs. In 1798, the Recorders Courts were established at Madras and\n",
      "Bombay, with powers identical to the Supreme Court of Calcutta. Afterwards, the Recorders Court at\n",
      "Madras was substituted by the Supreme Court (under the Parliament Act 1800). A few years later, the\n",
      "Recorders Court at Bombay was also replaced by the Supreme Court (under the Parliament Act\n",
      "1823). These new courts had indeed the same composition, jurisdiction and powers as exercised by\n",
      "the Supreme Court of Calcutta.\n",
      "The High Court of Judicature Act 1861 abolished the Supreme Courts as well as the Sadar Adalats,\n",
      "and in their place, constituted the High Court of Judicature for each Presidency Town. This Court\n",
      "consisted of a Chief Justice and such other number of judges, not exceeding 15. The Act prescribed\n",
      "professional qualifications for such judges together with the mode of their appointment. Thus, it\n",
      "was provided that 1/3rd of the judges should be appointed from amongst the barristers with 5 years\n",
      "standing and 1/3rd from amongst the civil servants, having 3 years experience as a District Judge.\n",
      "The remaining 1/3rd seats were filled from amongst pleaders and members of Subordinate\n",
      "Judiciary, having 5 years experience. The judges were appointed by the Crown and held office\n",
      "during his pleasure. The High Courts exercised original as well as appellate jurisdiction in civil and\n",
      "criminal matters and were also required to supervise the functioning of the Subordinate Courts in\n",
      "their respective domain. Besides the Presidency Towns, High Courts were also established in\n",

      "1. Introduction\n",
      "The roots of the current judicial system of Pakistan stretch back to the medieval period and even\n",
      "before. The judicial system that we practice today has evolved over a long period of time, spanning\n",
      "roughly over a whole millennium. The system has passed through several epochs, covering the\n",
      "Hindu era, Muslim period including the Mughal Empire, British colonial period and postindependence chapter. Notwithstanding the successive changes i.e. one rule/dynasty substituted\n",
      "by the other, which naturally resulted in the socio-economic and political transformation of the\n",
      "Indian society, the judicial system generally maintained a steady growth and gradual advance\n",
      "towards consolidation and improvement/refinement, without indeed, having to undergo any major\n",
      "disruption or breakdown. All in all, the system experienced and passed through 3 distinct stages of historical development,\n",
      "namely, Hindu Kingdom, Muslim Rule and British Colonial Administration. The 4th and current era,\n",
      "commenced with the partition of India and the establishment of Pakistan, as a sovereign and\n",
      "independent State. The system, thus, has evolved through a process of reform and development. This conclusion enjoys near unanimity among historians and commentators of Indian legal history. During this process of evolution and growth, the judicial system did receive influences and\n",
      "inspirations from foreign doctrines/notions and indigenous norms/practices, both in terms of\n",
      "organizing courts' structure, hierarchy, jurisdiction and adopting trial procedures/practices. Therefore, the present judicial system is not an entirely foreign transplant, as is commonly alleged,\n",
      "but has acquired an indigenous flavour and national colour. And whereas the system may not fully\n",
      "suit the genius of our people or meet the local conditions, its continued application and practice has\n",
      "made it intelligible to the common man. The very fact that increasing number of people are\n",
      "resorting to the courts for the resolution of their conflicts/disputes, indicates that the system enjoys\n",
      "a degree of legitimacy and acceptance. 2.\n",

      "Historical Retrospect\n",
      "2.1\n",
      "Hindu Period\n",
      "The Hindu period lasts for 3 millennia i.e. from 1500 BC until 1500 AD. Information on the judicial\n",
      "system during Hindu period has been somewhat sketchy, gathered mostly from scattered sources,\n",
      "such as ancient books like Dharamshastra, Smiritis and Arthashastra, and commentaries of the same\n",
      "by historians and jurists. These sources construct a well-defined system of administration of justice\n",
      "during the Hindu period. The King was regarded as the fountain of justice who also discharged\n",
      "judicial functions. In this task, judges as well as his ministers and counselors assisted him. He was the\n",
      "final judicial authority and court of ultimate appeal. At the Capital, besides the King's Court, the\n",
      "Court of Chief Justice existed. This Court, in hierarchy, was next to the King's Court and appeal\n",
      "against its decisions lay to the King's Court. The judges were appointed on the basis of their\n",
      "qualifications and scholarship but the choice was mostly restricted to upper caste i.e. Brahmins. 1\n",
      "\fThe Judicial System of Pakistan\n",
      "At the village level, tribunals dispensed justice, which consisted of the assembly of the village, or the\n",
      "caste or the family.1 The village Headman acted as Judge/Magistrate for the community. Decisions\n",
      "by such tribunals were usually through conciliation. The decisions of village/town courts/tribunals\n",
      "were appealable in the higher courts and final appeal lay before the King's Court. Besides\n",
      "adjudication, the system of arbitration was also in vogue. As regards the procedure followed in the courts/tribunals, no formal rules existed, as the law\n",
      "applicable was not statutory but customary or moral. The determination of truth and punishment of\n",
      "the wrong-doer was regarded as a religious duty. Civil proceedings commenced with the filing of a\n",
      "claim which was replied to by the opposite party. Both parties were allowed to produce witnesses so\n",
      "as to prove their respective claims. On the conclusion of the trial, decision was pronounced which\n",
      "was duly enforced. It appears thus, that the system of administration of justice, as it operated in\n",
      "ancient India, was not substantially different from what it is in the modern times. In a sense, the\n",
      "current system seems to be a continuation of the former practices and procedures. 2.2\n",
      "Muslim Period\n",
      "The Muslim period in the Indian sub-continent roughly begins in the 11th century A.D. This period\n",
      "may be divided into two parts i.e. the period of early Muslim rulers who ruled Delhi and some other\n",
      "parts of India and the Mughal period, which replaced such Muslim and other rulers in 1526 A.D. The\n",
      "Mughal Dynasty lasted until the middle of 19th century. During the period of Muslim rulers, the Islamic law remained the law of the land in settling civil and\n",
      "criminal disputes. However, common customs and traditions were also invoked in settling secular\n",
      "matters. These rulers were not particularly keen on applying the Islamic law to each and every sphere\n",
      "of life, and let the indigenous customs and institutions continue side by side with Islamic law and\n",
      "institutions. During this period, different courts were established and functioned at the central,\n",
      "provincial, district and tehsil (Pargana) level. These courts had defined jurisdiction in civil, criminal\n",
      "and revenue matters and operated under the authority of the King. On the top of judicial hierarchy\n",
      "was the King's Court, presided over by the King himself, exercising original as well as appellate\n",
      "jurisdiction. The King was the head of judicial administration and he made all appointments to\n",
      "judicial posts. Persons of recognised scholarship, known competence and high integrity were\n",
      "appointed to such posts. The judges held office during the pleasure of the King. The Mughals improved upon the previous experience and created an organised system of\n",
      "administration of justice, all over the country. Courts were created at each and every unit of the\n",
      "administrative division. At the village level, the Hindu system of Panchayats (Council of Elders) was\n",
      "retained, which decided petty disputes of civil and criminal nature, using conciliation and mediation\n",
      "as means of settling disputes. At the town level, there existed courts, presided over by\n",

      "Qazi-e-Parganah. Similarly, at the district (Sarkar) and provincial (Subah) level, courts of Qazis were\n",
      "established. The highest court at the provincial level was that of Adalat Nazim-e-Subah. Similarly, for\n",
      "revenue cases, officers known as Ameen were appointed at the town level. At the district level,\n",
      "revenue cases were dealt with by Amalguzar and at the provincial level by Diwan. The supreme revenue court was called, the Imperial Diwan. Side by side, with civil and revenue\n",
      "courts, criminal courts, presided over by Faujdar, Kotwal, Shiqdar and Subedar functioned.2 The\n",
      "highest court of the land was the Emperor's Court, exercising original and appellate jurisdiction. Although these courts generally exercised exclusive jurisdiction in different categories of cases,\n",
      "however, sometimes their jurisdiction was inter-mixed, in as much as, officers dealing with criminal\n",
      "cases were also required to act as revenue courts. Furthermore, whereas territorially, these courts\n",
      "formed a concentric organization, their jurisdiction was not always exclusive on the basis of\n",
      "territorial limits. Thus, a plaintiff may choose to file his suit in a town or a district or a province. The\n",
      "pecuniary jurisdiction of the courts was also not defined; hence, a case of higher value may be filed in\n",
      "a court of small town. Similarly, appellate jurisdiction existed but was not well defined. Thus, a\n",
      "plaintiff or a complainant, not satisfied with a decision, may file a second suit/complaint in another\n",
      "court. Such later court would decide the matter afresh, without indeed taking into consideration\n",
      "the earlier finding of the court. The emperor made the judicial appointments and persons of high scholarship and good reputation\n",
      "were appointed to the posts. Instructions were given to the judges to be neutral and impartial; and\n",
      "complaints against them were taken seriously. Corrupt officials were removed. Consequently, the\n",
      "scales of justice were very high.3\n",
      "The procedure followed in civil cases was not much different from the procedure, which is applicable\n",
      "today. On a suit being filed, the court summoned the opposite party to admit or deny the claim. Issues were framed in the presence of both the parties who were then required to produce evidence\n",
      "in support of their respective claims. Simple cases were decided, based on such evidence, however,\n",
      "in complicated cases, the judge may launch his own investigation into the matter.4 Maximum effort\n",
      "was made to find the truth. On the conclusion of the proceedings, judgment was pronounced and\n",
      "duly executed. Litigants were allowed to present their cases either personally or through agents. Such agents were not exactly lawyers (in the modern sense of the term) but were fully conversant\n",
      "with the judicial procedure. An officer of the court called Mufti, attached to the court, made the\n",
      "interpretation of law.5\n",

      "such powers. Thus, the Charter of 1661 authorized the Governor and Council to decide not only the\n",
      "cases of the Company employees but also of persons residing in the settlements. In deciding such\n",
      "cases, the Governor and the Council applied the English laws. As the character of the Company\n",
      "changed from one of a trading concern into a territorial power, newer and additional courts were\n",
      "established for deciding cases and settling disputes of its employees and subjects. The\n",
      "administration of justice was initially confined to the Presidency Town of Bombay, Calcutta and\n",
      "Madras. In view of the huge distances between these Towns and the peculiar conditions prevailing\n",
      "there, the administration of justice, which developed in these Towns, was not uniform. There were\n",
      "established two sets of courts, one for the Presidency Towns and the other for the Mufussil. The\n",
      "principal courts for the town were known as the Supreme Courts and Recorders Courts. These courts\n",
      "consisted of English judges and applied English laws. The English people, residing in such towns\n",
      "alone, were subject to their jurisdiction. The native inhabitants, who were mostly living in the\n",
      "Mufussil, were governed under separate courts called Sadar Dewani Adalat and Sadar Nizamat\n",
      "Adalat, dealing with civil and criminal cases respectively. Such courts applied the local laws and\n",
      "regulations. The Supreme Court of Calcutta was established under the Regulating Act 1773. The Court consisted\n",
      "of a Chief Justice and other judges, exercising both civil and criminal jurisdiction. The Court could\n",
      "also issue certain prerogative writs. In 1798, the Recorders Courts were established at Madras and\n",
      "Bombay, with powers identical to the Supreme Court of Calcutta. Afterwards, the Recorders Court at\n",
      "Madras was substituted by the Supreme Court (under the Parliament Act 1800). A few years later, the\n",
      "Recorders Court at Bombay was also replaced by the Supreme Court (under the Parliament Act\n",
      "1823). These new courts had indeed the same composition, jurisdiction and powers as exercised by\n",
      "the Supreme Court of Calcutta. The High Court of Judicature Act 1861 abolished the Supreme Courts as well as the Sadar Adalats,\n",
      "and in their place, constituted the High Court of Judicature for each Presidency Town. This Court\n",
      "consisted of a Chief Justice and such other number of judges, not exceeding 15. The Act prescribed\n",
      "professional qualifications for such judges together with the mode of their appointment. Thus, it\n",
      "was provided that 1/3rd of the judges should be appointed from amongst the barristers with 5 years\n",

      "Judiciary, having 5 years experience. The judges were appointed by the Crown and held office\n",
      "during his pleasure. The High Courts exercised original as well as appellate jurisdiction in civil and\n",
      "criminal matters and were also required to supervise the functioning of the Subordinate Courts in\n",
      "their respective domain. Besides the Presidency Towns, High Courts were also established in\n",

Introduction\\nThe roots of the current judicial system of Pakistan stretch back to the medieval period and even\\nbefore. The judicial system that we practice today has evolved over a long period of time, spanning\\nroughly over a whole millennium. The system has passed through several epochs, covering the\\nHindu era, Muslim period including the Mughal Empire, British colonial period and postindependence chapter. Notwithstanding the successive changes i.e. one rule/dynasty substituted\\nby the other, which naturally resulted in the socio-economic and political transformation of the\\nIndian society, the judicial system generally maintained a steady growth and gradual advance\\ntowards consolidation and improvement/refinement, without indeed, having to undergo any major\\ndisruption or breakdown. All in all, the system experienced and passed through 3 distinct stages of historical development,\\nnamely, Hindu Kingdom, Muslim Rule and British Colonial Administration. The 4th and current era,\\ncommenced with the partition of India and the establishment of Pakistan, as a sovereign and\\nindependent State. The system, thus, has evolved through a process of reform and development. This conclusion enjoys near unanimity among historians and commentators of Indian legal history. During this process of evolution and growth, the judicial system did receive influences and\\ninspirations from foreign doctrines/notions and indigenous norms/practices, both in terms of\\norganizing courts' structure, hierarchy, jurisdiction and adopting trial procedures/practices. Therefore, the present judicial system is not an entirely foreign transplant, as is commonly alleged,\\nbut has acquired an indigenous flavour and national colour. And whereas the system may not fully\\nsuit the genius of our people or meet the local conditions, its continued application and practice has\\nmade it intelligible to the common man. The very fact that increasing number of people are\\nresorting to the courts for the resolution of their conflicts/disputes, indicates that the system enjoys\\na degree of legitimacy and acceptance. 2.\"), Document(page_content=\"Historical Retrospect\\n2.1\\nHindu Period\\nThe Hindu period lasts for 3 millennia i.e. from 1500 BC until 1500 AD. Information on the judicial\\nsystem during Hindu period has been somewhat sketchy, gathered mostly from scattered sources,\\nsuch as ancient books like Dharamshastra, Smiritis and Arthashastra, and commentaries of the same\\nby historians and jurists. These sources construct a well-defined system of administration of justice\\nduring the Hindu period. The King was regarded as the fountain of justice who also discharged\\njudicial functions. In this task, judges as well as his ministers and counselors assisted him. He was the\\nfinal judicial authority and court of ultimate appeal. At the Capital, besides the King's Court, the\\nCourt of Chief Justice existed. This Court, in hierarchy, was next to the King's Court and appeal\\nagainst its decisions lay to the King's Court. The judges were appointed on the basis of their\\nqualifications and scholarship but the choice was mostly restricted to upper caste i.e. Brahmins. 1\\n\\x0cThe Judicial System of Pakistan\\nAt the village level, tribunals dispensed justice, which consisted of the assembly of the village, or the\\ncaste or the family.1 The village Headman acted as Judge/Magistrate for the community. Decisions\\nby such tribunals were usually through conciliation. The decisions of village/town courts/tribunals\\nwere appealable in the higher courts and final appeal lay before the King's Court. Besides\\nadjudication, the system of arbitration was also in vogue. As regards the procedure followed in the courts/tribunals, no formal rules existed, as the law\\napplicable was not statutory but customary or moral. The determination of truth and punishment of\\nthe wrong-doer was regarded as a religious duty. Civil proceedings commenced with the filing of a\\nclaim which was replied to by the opposite party. Both parties were allowed to produce witnesses so\\nas to prove their respective claims. On the conclusion of the trial, decision was pronounced which\\nwas duly enforced. It appears thus, that the system of administration of justice, as it operated in\\nancient India, was not substantially different from what it is in the modern times. In a sense, the\\ncurrent system seems to be a continuation of the former practices and procedures. 2.2\\nMuslim Period\\nThe Muslim period in the Indian sub-continent roughly begins in the 11th century A.D. This period\\nmay be divided into two parts i.e. the period of early Muslim rulers who ruled Delhi and some other\\nparts of India and the Mughal period, which replaced such Muslim and other rulers in 1526 A.D. The\\nMughal Dynasty lasted until the middle of 19th century. During the period of Muslim rulers, the Islamic law remained the law of the land in settling civil and\\ncriminal disputes. However, common customs and traditions were also invoked in settling secular\\nmatters. These rulers were not particularly keen on applying the Islamic law to each and every sphere\\nof life, and let the indigenous customs and institutions continue side by side with Islamic law and\\ninstitutions. During this period, different courts were established and functioned at the central,\\nprovincial, district and tehsil (Pargana) level. These courts had defined jurisdiction in civil, criminal\\nand revenue matters and operated under the authority of the King. On the top of judicial hierarchy\\nwas the King's Court, presided over by the King himself, exercising original as well as appellate\\njurisdiction. The King was the head of judicial administration and he made all appointments to\\njudicial posts. Persons of recognised scholarship, known competence and high integrity were\\nappointed to such posts. The judges held office during the pleasure of the King. The Mughals improved upon the previous experience and created an organised system of\\nadministration of justice, all over the country. Courts were created at each and every unit of the\\nadministrative division. At the village level, the Hindu system of Panchayats (Council of Elders) was\\nretained, which decided petty disputes of civil and criminal nature, using conciliation and mediation\\nas means of settling disputes. At the town level, there existed courts, presided over by\\nth Report of Law Commission of India, 1958, Vol. I, p 26\\n2\\n\\x0cThe Judicial System of Pakistan\\nQazi-e-Parganah. Similarly, at the district (Sarkar) and provincial (Subah) level, courts of Qazis were\\nestablished. The highest court at the provincial level was that of Adalat Nazim-e-Subah. Similarly, for\\nrevenue cases, officers known as Ameen were appointed at the town level. At the district level,\\nrevenue cases were dealt with by Amalguzar and at the provincial level by Diwan. The supreme revenue court was called, the Imperial Diwan. Side by side, with civil and revenue\\ncourts, criminal courts, presided over by Faujdar, Kotwal, Shiqdar and Subedar functioned.2 The\\nhighest court of the land was the Emperor's Court, exercising original and appellate jurisdiction. Although these courts generally exercised exclusive jurisdiction in different categories of cases,\\nhowever, sometimes their jurisdiction was inter-mixed, in as much as, officers dealing with criminal\\ncases were also required to act as revenue courts. Furthermore, whereas territorially, these courts\\nformed a concentric organization, their jurisdiction was not always exclusive on the basis of\\nterritorial limits. Thus, a plaintiff may choose to file his suit in a town or a district or a province. The\\npecuniary jurisdiction of the courts was also not defined; hence, a case of higher value may be filed in\\na court of small town. Similarly, appellate jurisdiction existed but was not well defined. Thus, a\\nplaintiff or a complainant, not satisfied with a decision, may file a second suit/complaint in another\\ncourt. Such later court would decide the matter afresh, without indeed taking into consideration\\nthe earlier finding of the court. The emperor made the judicial appointments and persons of high scholarship and good reputation\\nwere appointed to the posts. Instructions were given to the judges to be neutral and impartial; and\\ncomplaints against them were taken seriously. Corrupt officials were removed. Consequently, the\\nscales of justice were very high.3\\nThe procedure followed in civil cases was not much different from the procedure, which is applicable\\ntoday. On a suit being filed, the court summoned the opposite party to admit or deny the claim. Issues were framed in the presence of both the parties who were then required to produce evidence\\nin support of their respective claims. Simple cases were decided, based on such evidence, however,\\nin complicated cases, the judge may launch his own investigation into the matter.4 Maximum effort\\nwas made to find the truth. On the conclusion of the proceedings, judgment was pronounced and\\nduly executed. Litigants were allowed to present their cases either personally or through agents. Such agents were not exactly lawyers (in the modern sense of the term) but were fully conversant\\nwith the judicial procedure. An officer of the court called Mufti, attached to the court, made the\\ninterpretation of law.5\\n2\\nDr. Nasim Hassan Shah, Constitution, Law and Pakistan Affairs, 1986, Wajidalis Limited, Gulberg, Lahore, p 99\\nB.R.

The Company therefore established its own courts.\"), Document(page_content='The President and Council of the\\nCompany decided all cases of civil or criminal nature. The subsequent charters further expanded\\nsuch powers. Thus, the Charter of 1661 authorized the Governor and Council to decide not only the\\ncases of the Company employees but also of persons residing in the settlements. In deciding such\\ncases, the Governor and the Council applied the English laws. As the character of the Company\\nchanged from one of a trading concern into a territorial power, newer and additional courts were\\nestablished for deciding cases and settling disputes of its employees and subjects. The\\nadministration of justice was initially confined to the Presidency Town of Bombay, Calcutta and\\nMadras. In view of the huge distances between these Towns and the peculiar conditions prevailing\\nthere, the administration of justice, which developed in these Towns, was not uniform. There were\\nestablished two sets of courts, one for the Presidency Towns and the other for the Mufussil. The\\nprincipal courts for the town were known as the Supreme Courts and Recorders Courts. These courts\\nconsisted of English judges and applied English laws. The English people, residing in such towns\\nalone, were subject to their jurisdiction. The native inhabitants, who were mostly living in the\\nMufussil, were governed under separate courts called Sadar Dewani Adalat and Sadar Nizamat\\nAdalat, dealing with civil and criminal cases respectively. Such courts applied the local laws and\\nregulations. The Supreme Court of Calcutta was established under the Regulating Act 1773. The Court consisted\\nof a Chief Justice and other judges, exercising both civil and criminal jurisdiction. The Court could\\nalso issue certain prerogative writs. In 1798, the Recorders Courts were established at Madras and\\nBombay, with powers identical to the Supreme Court of Calcutta. Afterwards, the Recorders Court at\\nMadras was substituted by the Supreme Court (under the Parliament Act 1800). A few years later, the\\nRecorders Court at Bombay was also replaced by the Supreme Court (under the Parliament Act\\n1823). These new courts had indeed the same composition, jurisdiction and powers as exercised by\\nthe Supreme Court of Calcutta. The High Court of Judicature Act 1861 abolished the Supreme Courts as well as the Sadar Adalats,\\nand in their place, constituted the High Court of Judicature for each Presidency Town. This Court\\nconsisted of a Chief Justice and such other number of judges, not exceeding 15. The Act prescribed\\nprofessional qualifications for such judges together with the mode of their appointment. Thus, it\\nwas provided that 1/3rd of the judges should be appointed from amongst the barristers with 5 years\\nstanding and 1/3rd from amongst the civil servants, having 3 years experience as a District Judge. The remaining 1/3rd seats were filled from amongst pleaders and members of Subordinate\\nJudiciary, having 5 years experience. The judges were appointed by the Crown and held office\\nduring his pleasure. The High Courts exercised original as well as appellate jurisdiction in civil and\\ncriminal matters and were also required to supervise the functioning of the Subordinate Courts in\\ntheir respective domain. Besides the Presidency Towns, High Courts were also established in\\nAllahabad in 1866, Patna in 1919, Lahore in 1919 and Rangoon in 1936. The Sindh Chief Court was\\nestablished under the Sind Courts Act 1926. Similarly, under the NWFP Courts Regulation 1931 and\\n4\\n\\x0cThe Judicial System of Pakistan\\nthe British Balochistan Courts Regulation 1939, the Court of Judicial Commissioner was created in\\neach such area. The Code of Civil Procedure 1908 created principal civil courts, namely, the Court of District Judge,\\nthe Court of Additional District Judge, the Court of Civil Judge and the Court of Munsif. Their\\nterritorial and pecuniary jurisdictions were also defined. The Government of India Act 1935 retained the High Courts and also provided for the creation of a\\nFederal Court.6 The Federal Court was established in 1937. Its judges were appointed by the Crown\\nand held office till completing the age of 65 years. The qualifications prescribed were, 5 years\\nexperience as a judge of a High Court or 10 years experience as a barrister or 10 years experience as a\\npleader in a High Court. The Act further provided that the judges of the Federal Court and High\\nCourts should hold office during good health and behaviour, meaning, they may not be removed\\nexcept on the grounds of infirmity of mind or body or misbehaviour, only when on a reference made\\nby the Crown, the Judicial Committee of Privy Council so recommends. The Federal Court exercised\\noriginal, appellate and advisory jurisdiction.7\\n3. Post-Independence Evolution\\nOn independence, the Government of India Act 1935 was retained as a provisional Constitution. As a\\nconsequence, the legal and judicial system of the British period continued, of course, with due\\nadaptations and modifications, where necessary, to suit the requirements of the new Republic. This\\nway, there occurred no vacuum or breakdown, and the operation of the legal system continued\\nuninterrupted. The judicial structure also remained the same. The Lahore High Court continued to\\nfunction and so did the Sindh Chief Court and the courts of Judicial Commissioner in NWFP and\\nBalochistan. A new High Court was set up at Dacca.8 Similarly, a new Federal Court for Pakistan was\\nalso established.9 The powers, authority and jurisdiction of the Federal Court and High Courts, as\\nprescribed in the Government of India Act 1935, remained intact. The Government of India Act 1935 was amended in 1954 with a view to empower the High Courts to\\nissue the prerogative writs.10 The subsequent Constitutions i.e. 1956, 1962 and 1973 did not\\ndrastically alter the judicial structure or the powers and jurisdiction of the superior courts. The\\nchanges effected were, renaming the Federal Court as the Supreme Court by the 1956 Constitution\\nand the upgradation of the Chief Court of NWFP and Judicial Commissioner Court of Balochistan\\ninto full-fledged High Courts, by the 1973 Constitution. Later on, a new court called, Federal Shariat\\n6\\nSection 200\\nSection 204, 205, 207, 213\\n8\\nBy the High Court (Bengal) Order 1947\\n9\\nBy the Federal Government of Pakistan Order 1948\\n10\\nSection 223-A\\n\\n\\x0cThe Judicial System of Pakistan\\nCourt was created in 198011 with jurisdiction to determine, suo moto or on petition by a citizen or the\\nFederal or a provincial Government, as to whether or not a certain provision of law is repugnant to\\nthe injunctions of Islam.12\\nPakistan being a Federal Republic, the provinces enjoy wide powers, and subjects to administer\\nincluding the administration of justice. The High Court is the principal court of the province, which\\nexercises original jurisdiction (issuing writ for enforcement of Fundamental Rights) and appellate\\njurisdiction (against orders/judgments of Subordinate Courts and special courts).'), Document(page_content='The Subordinate\\nCourts function under the administrative control of the High Court. All such courts are funded by the\\nProvincial Government. 4. Superior Judiciary\\nThe Constitution of Pakistan deals with the superior judiciary in a fairly comprehensive manner and\\ncontains elaborate provisions on the composition, jurisdiction, powers and functions of these\\ncourts. The Constitution provides for the “separation of judiciary from the executive” and the\\n“independence of judiciary”13 It entrusts the superior courts with an obligation to “preserve, protect\\nand defend” the Constitution.14 The qualifications of judges, their mode of appointment,15 service\\nconditions, salary, pension,16 etc. are also laid down in the Constitution. The remuneration of judges\\nand other administrative expenditures of the superior courts are charged on the Federal/Provincial\\nConsolidated Fund,17 which means it may be discussed but cannot be voted upon in the legislature. The Constitution also provides for the grounds as well as forum and procedure for the removal of\\njudges of the superior courts.18 The Supreme Judicial Council, consisting of the senior judges of the\\nSupreme Court and High Courts, on its own or on a reference made by the President, may\\nrecommend the removal of a Judge on the ground of misconduct or physical or mental incapacity. Thus, the Constitution ensures the freedom, independence and impartiality of the superior\\njudiciary.'), Document(page_content='The Supreme Court and High Courts have recently been given a degree of financial autonomy. This\\nmeasure followed the Supreme Court ruling in the case of Government of Sind v Sharaf Faridi.19 The\\n11\\nArt 203-C\\nArt 203-D\\n13\\nPreamble, Art 2 A and Art 175 (3)\\n14\\nArt 178 & 194, read with the 3rd Schedule\\n15\\nArt 177 & 193\\n16\\nArt 205 read with the 5th Schedule\\n17\\nArt 81 & 118\\n18\\nArt 209\\n19\\nPLD 1994 SC 105\\n\\n\\x0cThe Judicial System of Pakistan\\nCourt held that the independence of judiciary also means the elimination of financial control of the\\nExecutive over the judiciary, and therefore, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court and High Courts\\nshould be authorized to make re-appropriation of funds within the budgetary allocation, without\\nthe approval of Finance Ministry. The Court went on to elaborate that the Chief Justices would thus\\nbe competent to re-appropriate amounts from one head to another and may also create or abolish\\nposts and upgrade or downgrade the same.20\\nThis ruling came during the course of interpretation of Article 175(3) of the Constitution, which\\nprovides that “judiciary shall be separated progressively from the Executive within 14 years”. The\\nCourt held that as per such constitutional mandate, the functions of magistracy should be\\nbifurcated and the judicial magistrates must be placed under the administrative control of the High\\nCourt. The Court fixed the 23rd of March 1994 as the last date for carrying out this measure. In its order dated 24th January 1996 on the review petition, the Supreme Court extended the said\\ndate to 23rd March 1996 and reiterated that separation must be effected by the due date and added\\nthat no request for further extension in time will be entertained. Consequently, through appropriate\\namendments in law, judicial magistrates were placed at the disposal of High Courts. Later, the\\nSupreme Court in the cases of Al-Jehad Trust v Federation21 and Asad Ali v Federation22 further\\ninterpreted various provisions in the Constitution and clarified the procedure and qualifications for\\nappointment to the Supreme Court and High Court and appointment of the Chief Justices of the said\\ncourts. This procedure was changed by the Constitution 18th & 19th (Amendments) Acts 2010. Before such\\namendments, the standing practice was that the Chief Justice of Pakistan used to recommend a\\npanel to the President and the President would select a suitable judge from the said panel. Similarly,\\nfor the appointment of judges in the High Courts, the respective Chief Justice would forward a panel\\nto the President which was routed through the Governor of the Province and Chief Justice of\\nPakistan. The recommendation of the Chief Justice was binding on the President, except for sound\\nreasons to be recorded by the President. 4.1\\nNew Procedure for Appointment\\nFollowing the adoption of Constitutional (18th & 19th) Amendments Acts 2011, new\\nprocess/procedure was prescribed for appointment of judges to the superior judiciary. The 18th Amendment was aimed at strengthening the parliamentary system and transferring\\nadditional subjects to the provinces. The Parliament also prescribed a new fora and procedure for\\nthe appointment of judges.'), Document(page_content=\"Cases of appointment in superior courts i.e. Supreme Court, Federal\\nShariat Court, High Courts are to be processed through two forums i.e. Judicial Commission of\\n20\\nIbid, p 115\\nPLD 1996 SC 324\\n22\\nPLD 1998 SC 33\\n\\n\\x0cThe Judicial System of Pakistan\\nPakistan and Parliamentary Committee. The Judicial Commission is headed by the Chief Justice of\\nPakistan and comprises senior judges of Supreme Court, Chief Justice and senior puisne judges of\\nHigh Court, Attorney General for Pakistan, Federal and Provincial Law Ministers, representatives of\\nthe Federal and Provincial Bar Councils, etc. The Commission nominates names for each vacancy and\\nforwards it to the Parliamentary Committee for confirmation. The Parliamentary Committee comprises eight members: four from National Assembly and four\\nfrom Senate. The Committee scrutinizes the nominations and names confirmed are forwarded to\\nthe President, through the Prime Minister, for appointment. The 18th Amendment was challenged in the Supreme Court and examined by a 17-member bench,\\nwhich decided to send a reference to the Parliament with certain recommendations to improve the\\nprocess and procedure of appointment of judges. The Parliament graciously considered the\\nreference and approved many a recommendations through the adoption of Constitution (19th\\nAmendment) Act 2010. In the light of 18th and 19th amendments, judges of Supreme Court are appointed through the\\nJudicial Commission which consists of Chief Justice of Pakistan as Chairman and four senior judges\\nof the Supreme Court, one former Chief Justice or judge of the Supreme Court, nominated by the\\nChairman, in consultation with the four member judges, as members. The remaining members are,\\nthe Attorney General for Pakistan, Federal Minister for Law and Justice and a senior advocate,\\nSupreme Court, nominated by the Pakistan Bar Council. Once the Judicial Commission approves a\\nnew name for appointment as judge of the Supreme Court, it goes to the eight-member\\nParliamentary Committee that has equal representation of the Government and the Opposition as\\nwell as of the two houses i.e. National Assembly and Senate. This Committee has two weeks to\\nconsider the nomination. If approved, the name is forwarded to the President, through the Prime\\nMinister, for appointment. The Parliamentary Committee, for reasons to be recorded, may not\\nconfirm the recommendation by three-fourth majority, in which instance, the decision is forwarded\\nto the Commission through the Prime Minister; and in that eventuality, the Commission is required\\nto send another nomination.23\\nNotwithstanding the procedure provided in Article 175A, the President has to appoint the most\\nsenior judge of the Supreme Court as the Chief Justice of Pakistan. As per opinion of the Supreme\\nCourt, on a Reference received from the President, the Government is not authorized to decide inter\\nse seniority of the judges.24 The issue was resolved by another verdict of the Supreme Court, wherein\\nit was held that the inter se sonority of judges of High Court shall reckon from the date of their\\nappointment as Additional Judge of High Court; however if appointed on the same day, then it shall\\nreckon from their seniority in age.25\\n23\\nArt 175A\\nReference No.1 of 2012\\n25\\nMuhammad Aslam Awan v Federation, 2014 SCMR 1289\\n\\n\\x0cThe Judicial System of Pakistan\\nFor appointment of Chief Justice and judges of Federal Shariat Court, the Chief Justice and most\\nsenior judge of the said court are added to the composition of the Judicial Commission, provided\\nthat for appointment of the Chief Justice, the most senior judge is excluded from such composition. Similarly, for appointment of Chief Justices and judges of High Courts, the Chief Justice and senior\\nmost judge of the respective High Court, provincial minister for law and an advocate of High Court\\n(15 years standing), as nominee of the provincial bar council, are added to the composition of the\\nCommission. However, for appointment of Chief Justice, the senior most judge is excluded from\\nsuch composition. Just like appointments in the Supreme Court, the Chief Justices and judges of the\\nFederal Shariat Court and High Courts are appointed by the President through their nomination by\\nthe Judicial Commission and confirmation by the Parliamentary Committee. 4.2\\nAccountability\\nThe system of accountability is an essential prerequisite of the independence of judiciary. The\\nConstitution of Pakistan prescribes such procedure in the form of Supreme Judicial Council. The\\nSupreme Judicial Council is a unique institution, which comprises the senior most judges in judicial\\nhierarchy and entrusted with the onerous responsibility of deciding complaints that are referred to\\nit. The Supreme Judicial Council is comprised of the Chief Justice of Pakistan, as Chairman, with two\\nmost senior Judges of the Supreme Court and two most senior Chief Justices of High Courts, as\\nmembers. The Registrar, Supreme Court of Pakistan acts as its Secretary. On a reference received\\nfrom President or through suo moto action, the Supreme Judicial Council investigates the matter\\nand presents its finding to the President. If the Council decides that the Judge is incapable of\\nperforming the duties of office or is guilty of misconduct, and therefore should be removed from\\noffice, the President may order the removal of such judge. A judge may not be removed from service\\nexcept on the specified grounds and subject to the prescribed procedure.26\\n4.3\\nSupreme Court\\nThe Supreme Court is the apex Court of the land, exercising original, appellate and advisory\\njurisdiction.27 It is the Court of ultimate appeal and final arbiter of law and the Constitution. Its\\ndecisions are binding on all other courts.28 The Court consists of a Chief Justice and other judges,29\\nappointed by the President as per procedure laid down in the Constitution.30 An Act of Parliament\\nhas fixed the number of Judges at 17 i.e. Chief Justice and 16 judges.31 There is also a provision for\\nappointment of acting judges as well as ad hoc judges in the court.32 A person with 5 years\\nexperience as a Judge of a High Court or 15 years standing as an advocate of a High Court, is eligible\\nto be appointed as judge of the Supreme Court.33\\n26\\nArt 209\\nArt 184, 185 & 186\\n28\\nArt 189\\n29\\nArt 176\\n30\\nArt 175 A\\n31\\nThe Supreme Court Number of Judges Act (Act No. XXXIII) of 1997\\n32\\nArt 181 & 182\\n33\\nArt 177\\n\\n\\x0cThe Judicial System of Pakistan\\nThe Court exercises original jurisdiction in settling inter-governmental disputes,34 be that dispute\\nbetween the Federal Government and a provincial government or among provincial governments. The Court also exercises original jurisdiction concurrently with High Courts for the enforcement of\\nFundamental Rights, where a question of 'public importance' is involved.35 The Court has appellate\\njurisdiction in civil and criminal matters.36 Furthermore, the Court has advisory jurisdiction in giving\\nopinion to the Government on a question of law.37\\nTo provide an expeditious and inexpensive remedy, in matters relating to infringements of\\nFundamental Rights, enshrined in Chapter II of the Constitution, a Human Rights Cell has been\\nestablished in the Court which now includes Expatriate Pakistanis Complaint Wing. The Cell\\nfunctions under the direct supervision of the Chief Justice of Pakistan.\"), Document(page_content='It is mandated to\\nexpeditiously process the complaints and grievances received from the general public. Many such\\nletters, applications and complaints are received. At the initial stage, a report is called from the head\\nof the Department/Agency, complained against. In case the grievance is redressed, the matter is\\ndisposed of. Cases requiring hearing are however fixed in Court and decided. In this way, relief is\\nprovided to the poor and vulnerable section of society without going through the traditional\\nprotracted litigation process. The public interest litigation in this form paved way for bringing relief\\nas well as statutory reforms in matters of general public importance, e.g., the enactment of the\\nBonded Labour System (Abolition) Act 1992, Human Organs and Tissues Act 2010, Prohibition of Kite\\nFlying (Amendment) Act 2009, Prohibition of Smoking and Protection of Non Smokers Health\\nOrdinance, 2002, etc. The Supreme Court appoints its own staff and determines their terms and conditions of service.38 The\\nSupreme Court (Appointment of Officers and Servants and Terms of Service) Rules 1982 prescribe\\nthe qualification for and mode of appointment and promotion of staff together with penalties and\\nprocedure for disciplinary proceedings against them. The Court may also frame its own rules of\\nprocedure. The Supreme Court Rules 1980 laid down detailed procedure for the filing of petitions\\nand appeals and their processing through the Court. As compared to the practice elsewhere in the world, particularly the United States and United\\nKingdom, where fewer cases reach the apex court, the Supreme Court of Pakistan deals with cases,\\nfar beyond its capacity to handle. Its jurisdiction ? original as well as appellate ? is fairly wide. Besides entertaining civil and criminal appeals from the High Courts, the Court also hears appeals\\nfrom the judgments against the Federal Shariat Court, Federal/provincial service tribunals and some\\nspecial courts. The Court also entertains cases of violation of Fundamental Rights under its original\\n34\\nArt 184(1)\\nArt 184(3)\\n36\\nArt 185\\n37\\nArt 186\\n38\\nArt 208\\n\\n\\x0cThe Judicial System of Pakistan\\njurisdiction i.e. Art 184(3). As a consequence, there is always huge number of pending cases before\\nthe Court. As per latest data available, on 31st December 2013, a total of 20,480 cases were pending\\nin the Supreme Court.39 Approximately, 14000 – 16000 cases (both petitions and appeals) are\\nannually filed in the Court. The current backlog is about 2200 cases. In addition, thousands of\\napplications/letters are annually received under Article 184(3) of the Constitution and processed by\\nthe Court. Obviously, the Court has a very heavy workload. To facilitate the litigant public and ensure prompt disposal of cases, the Court generally operates\\nthrough benches, working at the Principal Seat and the 4 Branch Registries, one at each provincial\\nmetropolis. Such benches work, almost round the year. Whereas the constitution of Benches and\\ntheir operation in various cities facilitate the public and ensures justice at the doorstep; the system\\ndoes affect the quality of judgments and deprives the Court of collective wisdom, so very vital for the\\napex Court, dealing with important issues, involving the interpretation of law/Constitution. There is,\\ntherefore, perhaps a need to re-examine the wisdom of bench system, which is however not\\npossible with the present workload, and rising trend of institution of cases, due to the wider\\njurisdiction of the Court. A way out may be the transfer of the court appellate jurisdiction under Art\\n212 (appeals in service matters) to High Courts. The High Courts could handle the extra workload, as\\nthere strength was recently increased (in 2008) and they are currently operating with full strength. Thus, they could deal with appeals arising out of the judgments of the provincial service tribunals. The appeals against verdicts of (Federal) Service Tribunal may be filed at the Islamabad High Court;\\nits strength however requires increase due to heavy pendency before it. 4.4\\nHigh Courts\\nThere is a High Court in each province and yet another High Court for the Islamabad Capital Territory. Each High Court consists of a Chief Justice and other puisne judges. The strength of Lahore High\\nCourt is fixed at 60, High Court of Sindh at 40, Peshawar High Court at 20, High Court of Balochistan at\\n11 and Islamabad High Court at 7. Qualifications mentioned for the post of a judge are, 10 years\\nexperience as an advocate of a High Court or 10 years service as a civil servant, including 3 years\\nexperience as a District Judge or 10 years experience in a judicial office.40\\nFor the appointment of judges of High Courts, in the past, the practice used to be that initially the\\nChief Justice of the concerned High Court would prepare a list of candidates which was submitted to\\nthe President, through the Governor of the province and the Chief Justice of Pakistan. The President\\nmade the final selection from the said list. Subsequently, however the Supreme Court, in the case of\\nAl-Jehad Trust v Federation41 ruled that the recommendation of the Chief Justice of Pakistan and\\nChief Justice of the High Court shall be binding on the President, except for sound reasons to the\\ncontrary. The court further ruled that the most senior judge would have legitimate expectancy of\\n39\\nJudicial Statistics of Pakistan 2013, published by the Law and Justice Commission of Pakistan, Islamabad\\nArt 193\\n41\\nPLD 1996 SC 324\\n\\n\\x0cThe Judicial System of Pakistan\\nbeing appointed as the Chief Justice, except for concrete and valid reasons, to be recorded by the\\nPresident. As mentioned earlier, the procedure of appointment of judges in the High Courts has been changed\\nafter the 18th and 19th amendments. The judges of High Courts are appointed by the Judicial\\nCommission and Parliamentary Committee. For appointment of judges of High Courts, the Judicial\\nCommission comprise the Chief Justice of Pakistan, as Chairman with four senior most judges of the\\nSupreme Court, one former Chief Justice or a retired judge of the Supreme Court, appointed by the\\nChairman, in consultation with the four member judges of Supreme Court, Attorney General for\\nPakistan, Federal Minister for Law & Justice, Chief Justice and most senior judge of the High Court to\\nwhich appointment is being made, provincial Minister for Law and an Advocate, (of fifteen years\\nstanding), nominated by the respective provincial Bar Council, as members. For appointment of\\nChief Justice, the requirement of most senior judge of the High Court, as member of the Commission\\nis excluded. Once the Judicial Commission approves a new name for appointment as judge of High\\nCourt, it goes to an 8-member Parliamentary Committee that has equal representation of the\\nGovernment and the Opposition as well as of two houses i.e. National Assembly and Senate. This\\nCommittee has two weeks to review the recommendation. If the recommendation is approved, it\\ngoes to the Prime Minister who forwards the same to the President for appointment. The\\nParliamentary Committee, for reasons to be recorded, may not confirm the recommendation by\\nthree-fourth majority; in which instance, the decision is forwarded to the Judicial Commission\\nthrough the Prime Minister, and the Commission is then required to send another nomination. The Court exercises original jurisdiction in the enforcement of Fundamental Rights and appellate\\njurisdiction in respect of judgments/orders of the Subordinate Courts in all civil and criminal\\nmatters. Appeals are also entertained against orders/judgments of Special Courts. A large number of\\ncases are pending in various High Courts. In the Lahore High Court, a total of 1,73,037 cases, in the\\nHigh Court of Sindh, 66,457 cases, in Peshawar High Court, 26,716 cases and in the High Court of\\nBalochistan, 4,923 cases were pending on 31st December 2013. In the newly established Islamabad\\nHigh Court, a total of 13,387 cases (both civil and criminal) were pending on 31st December 2013,42\\naround 10,000 of such cases were transferred to it from Lahore High Court. The High Court supervises and controls all the courts subordinate to it.43 It appoints its own staff44\\nand frames rules of procedure for itself as well as courts subordinate to it.45\\nAn extremely controversial provision in the Constitution had been the transfer of a judge from one\\nHigh Court to another, without his consent or after consultation with the Chief Justice of Pakistan or\\n42\\nJudicial Statistics of Pakistan, op.cit. Art 203\\n44\\nArt 208\\n45\\nArt 202\\n\\n\\x0cThe Judicial System of Pakistan\\nChief Justices of the concerned High Courts.46 The original 1973 Constitution made such a transfer\\nsubject to such consent as well as consultation. A proviso added by the Constitution (Fifth\\nAmendment) Act 1976, empowered the President to order such transfer for a period, not exceeding\\none year; and the President Order No.'), Document(page_content=\"14 of 1985 extended such period from one to two years. This\\nclause was however deleted by the Constitution 18th Amendment and the original clause resorted. Now a judge of a High Court cannot be transferred without his consent and consultation with the\\nChief Justice of Pakistan and Chief Justices of both the High Courts. 4.5\\nFederal Shariat Court\\nThe Court consists of 8 Muslim judges including the Chief Justice.47 Procedure for appointment of\\njudges of Federal Shariat Court has been changed after 18th and 19th amendments as previously\\nsuch judges were appointed by the President from amongst the serving or retired judges of the\\nSupreme Court or a High Court or from amongst persons possessing the qualifications of a judge of\\nthe High Court. At present, the judges of Federal Shariat Court are also appointed through the\\nJudicial Commission, which comprises the Chief Justice of Pakistan, as Chairman with four senior\\nmost Judges of the Supreme Court, one former Chief Justice or a retired judge of the Supreme Court,\\nappointed by the Chairman, in consultation with the four member judges of the Supreme Court,\\nAttorney General for Pakistan, the Federal Minister for Law and Justice, Chief Justice of Federal\\nShariat Court and most senior judge of the Federal Shariat Court, as members. For appointment of\\nChief Justice, however, the most senior judge of the Federal Shariat Court is excluded from the\\ncomposition of the Commission. Once the Judicial Commission approves a new name for\\nappointment as a judge of the Federal Shariat Court, it goes to an 8-member Parliamentary\\nCommittee that has equal representation of the Government and the Opposition as well as of two\\nhouses i.e. National Assembly and Senate. This Committee has two weeks to review the\\nrecommendation. If the recommendation is approved, it goes to the Prime Minister who forwards\\nthe same to the President for appointment. The Parliamentary Committee, for reasons to be\\nrecorded, may not confirm the recommendation by three-fourth majority, in which instance, the\\ndecision is forwarded to the Commission through the Prime Minister, and the Commission is\\nrequired to send another nomination. Of the 8 judges, 3 are required to be Ulema (Islamic scholars), who are well versed in Islamic law. The\\njudges hold office for a period of 3 years and the President may further extend such period.48\\nThe Court may, on its own motion or through petition by a citizen or a government (Federal or\\nprovincial), may examine and determine as to whether or not, a certain provision of law is repugnant\\nto the injunctions of Islam.49 Appeal against its decision lies to the Shariat Appellate Bench of the\\n46\\nArt 200\\nArt 203-C\\n48\\nArt 203-C\\n49\\nArt 203-D\\n\\n\\x0cThe Judicial System of Pakistan\\nSupreme Court, consisting of 3 Muslim judges of the Supreme Court and not more than 2 Ulema\\n(Islamic scholars), appointed by the President.50 If a certain provision of law is declared to be\\nrepugnant to the injunctions of Islam, the Government is required to take necessary steps to amend\\nthe law, so as to bring it in conformity with the injunctions of Islam. The Court also exercises appellate\\nand revisional jurisdiction over the criminal courts, deciding Hudood cases.51\\nThe decisions of the Court are binding on the High Courts as well as Subordinate Judiciary.52 The\\nCourt appoints its own staff53 and frames its own rules of procedure.54 On 31st December 2013, a total\\nof 997 cases were pending before the Court.55\\nEver since its establishment in 1980, the Federal Shariat Court has been the subject of controversy in\\nthe country. Created as an Islamisation measure by the Military regime56 and subsequently\\nprotected under the controversial 8th Amendment,57 its opponents question the very rationale and\\nutility of this institution. It is argued that this Court merely duplicates the functions of the existing\\nsuperior courts. The composition of the Court, particularly the loose qualifications of judges and the\\ninsecurity of their tenure, is taken exception to; and it is alleged, that this Court does not fully meet\\nthe criterion prescribed for the independence of the judiciary, hence, susceptible to pressure and\\ninfluence from the Executive. In the past, this Court was used as a dumping ground for the\\nrecalcitrant judges. And whereas some of its judgments, particularly the ones which relying on the\\nIslamic concept of equity, justice and fair play, expanded and enlarged the scope and contents of\\nindividual's rights were commended, others that validated the controversial Hudood laws, in\\nparticular, the sentence of Rajam (stoning to death) are severely criticised and deplored. With the\\nadoption of Protection of Women (Criminal Laws Amendment) Act 2006, the jurisdiction of the\\nCourt is considerably curtailed, inasmuch as, appeals/applications for revision arising out of trial of\\noffences are taken out from the Offence of Zina (Enforcement of Hudood) Ordinance 1979, hence are\\nno longer filed before this Court. They are filed before the High Court. In a recent verdict (Shariat\\nPetition 1/1 of 2010), the Court sought to extend its jurisdiction to all matters mentioned as Hudood\\nin the Islamic injunctions and further declared certain amendments to the Protection of Women\\n(Criminal Law Amendment) Act 2006 as repugnant to the injunctions of Islam. However an appeal\\nagainst this decision has been filed before the Supreme Court and as such the implementation of\\nthis judgment is stayed. Appeals against the judgments of the Federal Shariat are heard by the 5member Shariat Appellate Bench of the said Court. 50\\nArt 203-F\\nArt 203-D\\n52\\nArt 203-G\\n53\\nArt 208\\n54\\nArt 203-J\\n55\\nJudicial Statistics of Pakistan, op.cit. 56\\nBy the Constitution (Amendment) Order 1980\\n57\\nConstitution (8th Amendment) Act\\n\\n\\x0cThe Judicial System of Pakistan\\n5. Subordinate Courts\\nThe Subordinate Judiciary may be broadly divided into two classes; one, civil courts, established\\nunder the Civil Courts Ordinance 1962, and two, criminal courts, created under the Code of Criminal\\nProcedure 1898. In addition, there also exist other courts and tribunals of civil and criminal nature,\\ncreated under special laws. Their jurisdiction, powers and functions are specified in the statutes,\\ncreating them. The decisions and judgments of such special courts are assailable before the superior\\njudiciary (High Court and/or Supreme Court) through revision or appeal. The provincial governments fund the justice sector. The civil and criminal courts judges and their\\nterms and conditions are regulated under the provincial rules. The High Court, however, exercises\\nadministrative control over such courts. The civil courts consist of District Judge, Additional District\\nJudge, Senior Civil Judge and Civil Judge Class I, II & III. Similarly, the criminal courts comprise of\\nSessions Judge, Additional Sessions Judge and Judicial Magistrate Class I, II & III. Law fixes their\\npecuniary and territorial jurisdictions. Appeal against the decision of civil courts lies to the District\\nJudge and to the High Court, if the value of the suit exceeds specified amount. Similarly, in keeping\\nwith the quantum of penalty, appeals against criminal courts lie to Sessions Judge or High Court. 6. Special Courts and Administrative Tribunals\\nThe Constitution authorizes the Federal Legislature to establish special courts as well as\\nadministrative courts and tribunals for dealing with federal subjects.58 Consequently, several special\\ncourts/tribunals have been created which operate under the administrative control of the Federal\\nGovernment. Most of these courts function under the Ministry of Law & Justice, however, certain\\ncourts also operate under other ministries/departments. Such courts/tribunals include: Special\\nCourts (Control of Narcotics Substances), Banking Courts (Recovery of Loans), Special Courts\\n(Offences in Banks), Special Courts (Customs, Taxation & Anti-smuggling), Income Tax Appellate\\nTribunal, Environmental Tribunal , Insurance Appellate Tribunal, Customs, Excise & Sales Tax\\nAppellate Tribunal, Special Judges (Central), Drugs Courts, Anti-terrorism Courts, Accountability\\nCourts. Similarly, the provincial governments have their own special courts/tribunals, established\\nunder statutes. Such provincial courts/tribunals include Labour Courts, Consumer Protection\\nCourts, Anti–terrorism Courts and Anti-corruption Courts. The judicial officers presiding over these\\ncourts are mostly appointed on deputation from the provincial judicial cadre. Besides, there exist revenue courts, operating under the WP Land Revenue Act 1967. The revenue\\ncourts may be classified as the Board of Revenue, Commissioner, Collector, Assistant Collector of the\\nFirst Grade and Second Grade. The provincial government that exercise administrative control over\\nthem, appoints such officers.\"), Document(page_content='The WP Land Revenue Act 1967 prescribes their powers and functions. 58\\nItem 14 of the Federal Legislative List\\n15\\n\\x0cThe Judicial System of Pakistan\\n6.1\\nService Tribunals\\nUnder Article 212 of the Constitution, the government is authorized to set up administrative courts\\nand tribunals for exercising exclusive jurisdiction in matters, relating to the terms and conditions of\\nservice of civil servants. Accordingly, service tribunal has been established at the Federal level.59 The\\nprovincial governments have established their own service tribunals. The members of these\\ntribunals were previously appointed by the respective government. However, as the service\\ntribunals, both Federal and provincial, perform judicial functions, the Supreme Court has directed\\nthe government to make appropriate legislation to ensure the independence and impartiality of\\nsuch bodies and ensure their financial autonomy.60 Appeals against the decision of the\\nFederal/provincial service tribunals lie to the Supreme Court. 7. Procedural Law\\nThe Code of Civil Procedure 1908 prescribes the procedure for proceedings in civil cases. The Code is\\nin two parts i.e. Sections, which contain the basic and fundamental principles and can be amended\\nonly by the legislature, and Orders, which contain rules of procedure and can be amended by the\\nHigh Court. The Code is indeed a consolidating statute, prescribing detailed procedure for\\ninstituting suit (meaning who may file a suit, how and where), pleadings (filing plaints/written\\nstatements, their form and particulars), proceedings, writing of judgment and execution of decrees. The Code has been reviewed from time to time and its provisions amended to keep pace with time\\nand changing conditions of the society.'), Document(page_content='Similarly, the Code of Criminal Procedure 1898 prescribes\\nthe criminal procedure. The Qanun-e-Shahadat Order 1984 prescribes the competency of witnesses,\\nthe examination of witnesses, form of evidence and the procedure for presenting the same. The\\nprocedure prescribed in the law applies to judicial proceedings and investigations by a court of law\\nin civil or criminal cases. The special courts follow the procedure prescribed in the above-mentioned\\ncodes, whereas some such courts follow special procedure, laid down in the respective statute. 8. Terms and Conditions of Service of Subordinate Judiciary\\nThe Subordinate Courts (civil and criminal) have been established and their jurisdiction defined by\\nlaw.61 They are supervised and controlled by the respective High Court.62 The administration of\\njustice, however, is a provincial subject and thus the Subordinate Courts are organised and the terms\\nand conditions of service of judicial officers determined under the provincial laws and rules. The\\nissues of recruitment, promotions and other terms and conditions of service, together with\\ndisciplinary proceedings, etc, are dealt with under the provincial civil servants acts and the High\\n59\\nService Tribunal Act 1973\\nRiazul Haq v Federation, PLD 2013 SC 30\\n61\\nArt 175\\n62\\nArt 203\\n\\n\\x0cThe Judicial System of Pakistan\\nCourt rules. Until recently, the appointing authority for judicial officers happened to be the\\nprovincial government but with the separation of judiciary from the executive, such authority has\\nbeen transferred to the High Court. Initial recruitment as Civil Judge-cum-Judicial Magistrate is\\nmade through written tests and viva voce examination, conducted by the respective High Court. A Committee of the judges of the High Court, decides the issue of promotion of judges. For\\nappointment as Additional District & Sessions Judge, quota is fixed for service personnel as well as\\ninduction from the Bar. Appointment as District & Sessions Judge is by promotion on the basis of\\nseniority-cum-fitness from among the serving judicial officers. After appointment, the civil judges-cum-Judicial Magistrate receive specialized training at the\\nFederal Judicial Academy and/or the respective provincial judicial academy. Such training includes\\neducation in various substantive/procedural laws, court management, case processing, judicial\\nprocedure, and code of conduct, etc. As mentioned earlier, the High Courts exercise supervision and control over the functioning of the\\nSubordinate Judiciary. Such supervision and control is both administrative as well as judicial. In the\\nadministrative sphere, disciplinary proceedings may be initiated against a judicial officer by the\\nHigh Court. Judicial control is also exercised through revision and appeals being filed in the High\\nCourt against the orders/decisions of the Subordinate Courts. The High Court carries out its\\nsupervisory functions through inspections and calling of record from the courts. The Member\\nInspection Team (MIT) mostly deals with the issue; however, the Chief Justice of the High Court or\\nany other judge deputed by the Chief Justice also carries out regular as well as surprise inspections. The Chief Justice is competent to initiate disciplinary proceedings against a judge and take\\nappropriate action in the matter. Disciplinary proceedings against judicial officers are usually initiated and action taken under the\\n(provincial) Government Servants (Efficiency and Discipline) Rules. Such rules were primarily\\ndesigned for the executive officers, whose duties and functions are different from judicial officers. Certain High Courts have adopted codes of conduct for Subordinate Judiciary, but they are quite\\nsketchy/inadequate. Thus, in their application to judicial officers, the current rules do contain many\\ngaps and anomalies. There is, therefore, a need for preparing a separate comprehensive code of\\nconduct for the members of the Subordinate Judiciary, covering their private and public life and in\\nparticular, their conduct in the court so as to maintain propriety and decorum in the court and\\nenhance public confidence in the administration of justice. As regards the grievances of the judicial officers with regard to the terms and conditions of service,\\nmechanism exists for resolving it. There exists a Provincial Judicial Service Tribunal for deciding\\nappeals against the final orders of departmental authority. The judges of the respective High Court\\nman such tribunals.'), Document(page_content='Appeal against their decision lies to the Supreme Court. 17\\n\\x0cThe Judicial System of Pakistan\\n8.1\\nWorkload\\nThe judiciary works under heavy workload. As against the bulging population and surge in litigation,\\nthe strength of judges has not increased in equal proportion. Thus, there are around 4200 judges\\n(combined strength of judges of Superior Courts, Subordinate Courts and Special\\nCourts/Administrative Tribunals) for a population of 180 million in Pakistan. It means that there is\\none judge for 42857 persons, which is far below the international standards. And whereas all the\\ncourts have heavy dockets, the Subordinate Courts have to bear the brunt. As first instance trial\\ncourts, most of the civil and criminal litigation is conducted at this level. According to one estimate,\\naround 90% of litigation in Pakistan is conducted at the level of Subordinate Courts and the rest at\\nthe level of High Courts and Supreme Court. The Subordinate Courts also operate under many\\nconstraints. There exists shortage of courtrooms, judicial officers, ministerial staff and office\\nequipment. The strength of Subordinate Judiciary has not kept pace with the rise in litigation due to\\nwhich huge backlog of pending cases is accumulated, and there are enormous delays in deciding\\ncases. As against the recommendations of several law reform commissions and committees that the\\nnumber of cases pending with a civil judge should not be more than 500 and the number of units\\npending with a District & Sessions Judge should not be more than 450 at a time, in actual practice,\\nthe number of cases and units is far in excess of this prescribed limit. 8.2\\nNational Judicial Policy\\nIn an effort to reduce the backlog and streamline the judicial system in the country, and make it\\nresponsive to the present-day requirements of society, the National Judicial Policy 2009 was framed. The Policy was formulated by the National Judicial (Policy Making) Committee, headed by the Chief\\nJustice of Pakistan, with Chief Justices of Federal Shariat and High Courts as members. The National Judicial Policy was aimed at ensuring easy access to justice at the grassroot level. It was\\nformulated in the aftermath of Judges-Restoration Movement (2007-2009), with a view to improve\\nthe performance of justice sector in order to enhance public trust in the administration of justice. The\\nsalient features of the Policy were: strengthening the independent of judiciary, its complete\\nseparation from the executive, eradication of corruption and expeditious disposal of cases. The major thrust of the Policy was on disposal of pending cases in the superior courts as well as\\nSubordinate Courts all over the country. The courts, especially the Subordinate Courts, performed\\nvery well and achieved the targets, set for disposal. During the first year of its operation i.e.1st June\\n2009 till 31st May 2010, the Supreme Court, Federal Shariat Court, all High Courts and all\\nSubordinate Courts in the country, decided a total of 30, 93,658 cases. The Policy worked well, made\\nthe people aware of their rights and motivated them to approach the courts for quick disposal of\\ntheir cases. In the subsequent years, the backlog was further curtailed. As a result, currently in the province of\\nBalochistan, there is no backlog at any level. A civil or criminal case is decided within a year of its\\ninstitution. In the province of KPk, the trial span is reduced to 1-1/2 year. The remaining provinces i.e.'), Document(page_content='Sindh and Punjab are catching up. As per latest data available, on 31st December 2013, in the\\n18\\n\\x0cThe Judicial System of Pakistan\\nProvince of the Punjab, the number of pending cases was 1,107,634, in Sindh, 124,190, in KPk,\\n132,762, in Balochistan 8444 and in Islamabad Capital Territory 30300.63\\nThe courts worked hard and extra hours to achieve the disposal targets. The bar and litigants also\\ncooperated and extended support in the endeavour to reduce to backlog and decide cases more\\nexpeditiously. During the year 2012-13, the superior courts i.e. the Supreme Court, Federal Shariat\\nCourt, and High Courts decided a total of 25,19,674 cases, whereas in 2007 and 2008, 93,378 and\\n117,738 cases respectively were adjudicated upon, which shows a rising trend in the disposal of\\ncases. The number of cases decided by the Lahore High Court is 53, 877, 74542 and 116338 in 2007,\\n2008 and 2012-13 respectively, which clearly shows increased disposal of cases during 2012-13, as\\ncompared to the disposal of cases in 2008. Similarly, in the High Court of Sindh, 18145 cases were\\ndecided in the year 2012-13, which was previously 12493 and 16524 in 2007 and 2008 respectively. In the Peshawar High Court, the disposal is 11627, 11556 and 20457 in 2007, 2008 and 2013\\nrespectively. Hence, there is increased disposal of cases. In the High Court of Balochistan the disposal\\nrate was 3297, 3627 and 3896 respectively in 2007, 2008 and 2013.

      "roughly over a whole millennium. The system has passed through several epochs, covering the\n",
      "Hindu era, Muslim period including the Mughal Empire, British colonial period and postindependence chapter. Notwithstanding the successive changes i.e. one rule/dynasty substituted\n",
      "by the other, which naturally resulted in the socio-economic and political transformation of the\n",
      "Indian society, the judicial system generally maintained a steady growth and gradual advance\n",
      "towards consolidation and improvement/refinement, without indeed, having to undergo any major\n",
      "disruption or breakdown. All in all, the system experienced and passed through 3 distinct stages of historical development,\n",
      "namely, Hindu Kingdom, Muslim Rule and British Colonial Administration. The 4th and current era,\n",
      "commenced with the partition of India and the establishment of Pakistan, as a sovereign and\n",
      "independent State. The system, thus, has evolved through a process of reform and development. This conclusion enjoys near unanimity among historians and commentators of Indian legal history. During this process of evolution and growth, the judicial system did receive influences and\n",
      "inspirations from foreign doctrines/notions and indigenous norms/practices, both in terms of\n",
      "organizing courts' structure, hierarchy, jurisdiction and adopting trial procedures/practices. Therefore, the present judicial system is not an entirely foreign transplant, as is commonly alleged,\n",
      "but has acquired an indigenous flavour and national colour. And whereas the system may not fully\n",
      "suit the genius of our people or meet the local conditions, its continued application and practice has\n",
      "made it intelligible to the common man. The very fact that increasing number of people are\n",
